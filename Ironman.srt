1
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,367
I feel like you're driving me to court martial.
This is crazy

2
00:01:29,534 --> 00:01:32,286
What did I do?
I feel like you're gonna pull over and snuff me

3
00:01:32,495 --> 00:01:34,872
What, you're not allowed to talk?
Hey, Forest...

4
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:38,041
- We can talk, sir.
- Oh, I see. So it's personal?

5
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:39,792
No, you intimidate them

6
00:01:40,001 --> 00:01:42,920
Dear God, you're a woman!
I honestly, I couldn't have called that

7
00:01:43,087 --> 00:01:45,672
I mean, I would apologize,
but isn't that what we're going for here?

8
00:01:45,882 --> 00:01:48,259
I thought of you as a soldier first.
I'm an airman

9
00:01:48,467 --> 00:01:51,469
Well you have actually excellent bone structure there.
I'm kinda...

10
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:54,472
having a hard time not looking at you now.
Is that weird?

11
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,474
C'mon, it's OK, laugh. Hey!

12
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:59,060
- Sir, I have a question to ask.
- Yes, please

13
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:02,480
It is true you went 12-for-12 with last year's
Maxim cover models?

14
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,314
That is an excellent question

15
00:02:04,523 --> 00:02:06,941
Yes and no. March and I had a scheduling conflict

16
00:02:07,151 --> 00:02:10,487
but fortunately the Christmas cover was twins.
Anything else?

17
00:02:10,904 --> 00:02:12,613
You're kidding me with a hand up, right?

18
00:02:12,906 --> 00:02:14,907
Is it cool if I take a picture with you?

19
00:02:15,116 --> 00:02:16,784
Yes, it's very cool

20
00:02:21,288 --> 00:02:23,498
I don't wanna see this on your MySpace page

21
00:02:23,707 --> 00:02:25,250
Please, no gang signs

22
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:26,960
No, throw it up, I'm kidding

23
00:02:27,169 --> 00:02:30,171
Yeah, peace! I love peace.
I'd be outta job with peace

24
00:02:30,463 --> 00:02:34,216
C'mon! Just click it, don't change the settings, just click it

25
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,389
What's going on?

26
00:02:44,684 --> 00:02:46,894
Jimmy, stay with Stark!

27
00:02:47,103 --> 00:02:48,479
Lie down!

28
00:02:54,276 --> 00:02:55,777
Son of a bitch!

29
00:02:57,446 --> 00:03:00,281
- Wait, wait, give me a gun!
- Stay here!

30
00:04:20,103 --> 00:04:21,562
Tony Stark

31
00:04:24,023 --> 00:04:27,442
Visionary. Genius. American patriot

32
00:04:28,193 --> 00:04:29,944
Even from an early age

33
00:04:30,154 --> 00:04:32,531
the son of legendary weapons developer Howard Stark

34
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,783
quickly stole the spotlight with his brilliant and unique mind

35
00:04:35,992 --> 00:04:39,036
At age four, he built his first circuit board

36
00:04:39,287 --> 00:04:42,039
At age six, his first engine

37
00:04:42,414 --> 00:04:46,250
And at seventeen,
he graduated Summa Cum Laude from MIT

38
00:04:47,044 --> 00:04:49,921
Then, the passing of a titan

39
00:04:50,922 --> 00:04:53,924
Howard Stark's life long friend and ally Obadiah Stane

40
00:04:54,133 --> 00:04:57,260
steps in to help fill the gap left by the legendary founder

41
00:04:57,428 --> 00:05:00,597
Until at age 21, the prodigal son returns

42
00:05:00,764 --> 00:05:04,016
and is anointed the new CEO of Stark Industries

43
00:05:04,226 --> 00:05:07,270
With the keys to the kingdom,
Tony ushers in a new era

44
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:10,189
for his father's legacy, creating smarter weapons

45
00:05:10,398 --> 00:05:12,775
advanced robotics, satellite targeting

46
00:05:12,983 --> 00:05:16,652
Today, Tony Stark has changed the face of the weapons industry

47
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,404
by ensuring freedom

48
00:05:18,613 --> 00:05:22,491
and protecting America and her interests around the globe

49
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:33,210
As liaison to Stark Industries

50
00:05:33,502 --> 00:05:37,338
I've had the unique privilege of serving with a real patriot

51
00:05:37,547 --> 00:05:41,091
He is my friend and he is my great mentor

52
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:44,094
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor

53
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:48,348
to present this year's Apogee Award to Mr. Tony Stark!

54
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,272
Tony?

55
00:06:09,117 --> 00:06:11,160
Thank you, Colonel

56
00:06:11,869 --> 00:06:14,287
This is beautiful. Thank you

57
00:06:14,497 --> 00:06:17,499
Thank you all very much. This is wonderful

58
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:21,544
Well, I'm not Tony Stark

59
00:06:22,712 --> 00:06:24,713
But if I were Tony...

60
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:28,133
...I would tell you how honored I feel

61
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:32,762
and what a joy it is to receive this very prestigious award

62
00:06:33,472 --> 00:06:36,891
Tony, you know, the best thing about Tony...

63
00:06:37,059 --> 00:06:40,478
...is also the worst thing
he's always working

64
00:06:45,066 --> 00:06:46,525
C'mon!

65
00:06:48,944 --> 00:06:50,945
We should just stay till the morning

66
00:06:51,155 --> 00:06:54,574
- You are unbelievable!
- Oh, no. They roped you into this?

67
00:06:54,741 --> 00:06:57,368
Nobody roped me into anything.
But they told me...

68
00:06:57,577 --> 00:07:00,120
that if I presented you with an award, you'd be deeply honored

69
00:07:00,288 --> 00:07:02,498
Of course I'd be deeply honored. And it's you!

70
00:07:02,707 --> 00:07:05,542
That's great. So when do we do it? One more round.
There you go

71
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:08,086
There it is. That was easy. I'm so sorry.
Yeah, it's OK

72
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:10,672
Wow, would you look at that?
That's... that's something else

73
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:13,466
I don't have any of those swooping around. All right, ride!

74
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:17,844
Give me a hand, will you? OK, you too

75
00:07:18,262 --> 00:07:20,472
I don't blow on man's hands

76
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,016
There it is! It's the Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes' roll, and...

77
00:07:23,225 --> 00:07:24,851
That's what happens

78
00:07:25,018 --> 00:07:27,228
Worse things have happened, I think we're gonna be fine

79
00:07:27,437 --> 00:07:29,146
Color me up, will you? - This is where I exit

80
00:07:29,355 --> 00:07:31,398
- Tomorrow don't be late.
- Yeah, you can count on it

81
00:07:31,607 --> 00:07:33,108
- I'm serious.
- I know, I know

82
00:07:33,276 --> 00:07:36,445
Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's.
There you go

83
00:07:41,074 --> 00:07:43,284
Mr. Stark! Excuse me! Mr. Stark!

84
00:07:43,493 --> 00:07:45,828
Christine Everheart, Vanity Fair magazine

85
00:07:46,037 --> 00:07:47,663
Can I ask you a couple of questions?
She's cute

86
00:07:47,872 --> 00:07:49,832
- She's alright? Hi.
- Hi

87
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,667
Yeah. Okay, go

88
00:07:51,876 --> 00:07:54,753
You've been called the Da Vinci of our time.
What do you say to that?

89
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,671
Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint

90
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,882
And what do you say to your other nickname,
the Merchant of Death?

91
00:08:00,091 --> 00:08:03,719
That's not bad.
Let me guess... Berkeley?

92
00:08:03,928 --> 00:08:05,304
Brown, actually

93
00:08:05,513 --> 00:08:07,306
Well, Ms. Brown

94
00:08:07,515 --> 00:08:10,142
It's an imperfect world, but it's the only one we've got

95
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,893
I guarantee you the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace

96
00:08:13,103 --> 00:08:15,271
we'll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals

97
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,314
Rehearse that much?

98
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:18,315
Every night in front of the mirror before bedtime

99
00:08:18,483 --> 00:08:20,568
- I can see that.
- I'd like to show you firsthand

100
00:08:20,776 --> 00:08:22,819
All I want is the serious answer

101
00:08:23,028 --> 00:08:25,029
Okay, here is serious.
My old man had a philosophy:

102
00:08:25,197 --> 00:08:27,782
"Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy."

103
00:08:27,991 --> 00:08:30,034
That's a great line, coming from a guy selling the sticks

104
00:08:30,201 --> 00:08:32,911
My father helped defeat Nazis.
He worked on the Manhattan Project

105
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:35,331
A lot of people, including your professors at Brown

106
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,916
would call that being a hero

107
00:08:37,124 --> 00:08:39,125
And a lot of people would also call that war-profiteering

108
00:08:39,335 --> 00:08:40,711
Tell me, do you plan to report

109
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,421
on the millions we've saved by advancing medical technology?

110
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:46,090
Or kept from starvation with our intelli-crops?

111
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:49,510
All those breakthroughs: military funding, honey

112
00:08:49,927 --> 00:08:52,929
Wow, did you ever lose an hour of sleep your whole life?

113
00:08:53,097 --> 00:08:55,724
I'd be prepared to lose a few with you

114
00:09:08,819 --> 00:09:10,653
Good morning. It's 7 am

115
00:09:10,821 --> 00:09:14,282
The weather in Malibu is 72 degrees with scattered clouds

116
00:09:14,491 --> 00:09:17,326
The surf conditions are fair with waist to shoulder highlines

117
00:09:17,494 --> 00:09:20,288
high tide will be at 10:52 a.m

118
00:09:37,553 --> 00:09:40,764
Tony? Hey, Tony!

119
00:10:03,285 --> 00:10:05,870
You are not authorized to access this area.
Jesus!

120
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,581
That's Jarvis, he runs the house

121
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,208
I've got your clothes here, they've been dry cleaned and pressed

122
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:13,418
And there's a car waiting for you outside

123
00:10:13,627 --> 00:10:15,628
that will take you anywhere you'd like to go

124
00:10:16,004 --> 00:10:19,715
You must be the famous Pepper Potts.
Indeed I am

125
00:10:20,884 --> 00:10:24,512
After all these years,
Tony still has you picking up the dry cleaning?

126
00:10:25,096 --> 00:10:28,140
I do anything and everything that Mr. Stark requires

127
00:10:28,349 --> 00:10:32,102
Including occasionally taking out the trash.
Would that be all?

128
00:10:49,451 --> 00:10:51,244
Give me the exploded view

129
00:10:51,453 --> 00:10:54,205
The compression in cylinder 3 appears to be low

130
00:10:54,914 --> 00:10:56,707
Note that

131
00:10:59,627 --> 00:11:01,628
- I'll try again later...
- Please don't turn down my music

132
00:11:01,754 --> 00:11:03,046
I'll keep you posted

133
00:11:03,255 --> 00:11:05,340
You are supposed to be half way around the world right now

134
00:11:05,549 --> 00:11:07,133
- How did she take it?
- Like a champ

135
00:11:07,342 --> 00:11:08,801
Might've tried to hustle me out of here

136
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,802
Your flight was scheduled to leave an hour and a half ago

137
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,804
That's funny...
I thought with it being my plane and all

138
00:11:13,014 --> 00:11:14,306
that it would just wait for me to get there

139
00:11:14,515 --> 00:11:16,933
I need to speak to you about couple
of things before I get you outta the door

140
00:11:17,142 --> 00:11:19,727
I mean, doesn't it kind of defeat the purpose of having your own plane

141
00:11:19,937 --> 00:11:21,229
if it departs before you arrive?

142
00:11:21,438 --> 00:11:24,023
Larry called, he's got another buyer for the Jackson Pollock

143
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,358
in the wings, do you want it, yes or no?

144
00:11:26,568 --> 00:11:29,070
Is it a good representation of his Spring Period?

145
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:31,696
No the "Springs" is actually the neighborhood in East Hampton

146
00:11:31,906 --> 00:11:34,491
where he lived and worked, not "spring" like the season

147
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,701
I think it's a fair example...

148
00:11:37,035 --> 00:11:39,495
I think it's incredibly overpriced

149
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:42,206
I need it. Buy it, store it

150
00:11:43,249 --> 00:11:45,542
Okay... the MIT commencement speech

151
00:11:45,751 --> 00:11:48,003
Is in June... please, don't harangue me about that stuff

152
00:11:48,212 --> 00:11:50,964
Well, they are haranguing me, so I'm gonna say yes...

153
00:11:51,173 --> 00:11:53,842
I need you to sign this before you get on the plane

154
00:11:54,009 --> 00:11:55,969
What are you trying to get rid of me for? What, you got plans?

155
00:11:56,177 --> 00:11:58,679
- As a matter of fact, I do.
- I don't like it when you have plans

156
00:11:58,888 --> 00:12:00,889
I'm allowed to have plans on my birthday

157
00:12:01,098 --> 00:12:04,267
It's your birthday.
Yes. I knew that. Already?

158
00:12:04,435 --> 00:12:07,646
Yeah, isn't that strange, it's the same day as last year

159
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:11,190
Well, get yourself something nice from me.
I already did

160
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,609
- And?
- Oh, it was very nice

161
00:12:14,485 --> 00:12:17,571
Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark

162
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:20,448
You're welcome, Ms. Potts

163
00:12:42,844 --> 00:12:46,555
You're good! I thought I've lost you back there

164
00:12:46,723 --> 00:12:48,766
You did, sir

165
00:12:49,266 --> 00:12:52,268
I took it across Mojave.
Ah, I gotcha, I gotcha

166
00:12:52,478 --> 00:12:54,688
What's wrong with you?
What?

167
00:12:54,896 --> 00:12:57,523
Three hours!
I got caught doing a piece for Vanity Fair

168
00:12:57,732 --> 00:12:59,942
Three hours. For three hours, you got me standing here

169
00:13:00,193 --> 00:13:02,820
I'm waiting on you now. Lets go. C'mon

170
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:05,447
Wheels up! Rock and roll!

171
00:13:13,205 --> 00:13:15,582
What're you reading?
Nothing

172
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,042
C'mon, sourpatch, don't be mad

173
00:13:18,251 --> 00:13:20,711
I told you I'm not mad, I'm indifferent, okay?

174
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,713
- I said I was sorry.
- Good morning, Mr. Stark

175
00:13:22,922 --> 00:13:24,756
- No need to apologize.
- I told him I was sorry but he...

176
00:13:24,965 --> 00:13:26,341
I'm just indifferent right now

177
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,010
You don't respect yourself, so I know you don't respect me

178
00:13:29,219 --> 00:13:30,636
- I respect you.
- I'm just your babysitter

179
00:13:30,845 --> 00:13:32,846
and so, when you need your diaper changed, thank you...

180
00:13:33,056 --> 00:13:35,182
let me know and I'll get you a bottle, okay?

181
00:13:35,391 --> 00:13:37,851
Hey, heat up the sake, will you?
Thanks for reminding me

182
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,562
I'm not talking... we're not drinking, we're working right now

183
00:13:40,771 --> 00:13:44,232
And you are constitutionally incapable of being responsible

184
00:13:44,482 --> 00:13:46,066
It would be irresponsible not to drink

185
00:13:46,234 --> 00:13:48,068
I'm just talking about the night cup.
Hot sake?

186
00:13:48,236 --> 00:13:49,612
- Yes, two please.
- No, just...

187
00:13:49,821 --> 00:13:51,822
I'm not drinking, I don't want any

188
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:54,866
That's what I'm talking about.
When I get up in the morning

189
00:13:55,075 --> 00:13:57,994
and I'm putting on my uniform, you know what I recognize?

190
00:13:58,245 --> 00:14:02,081
I see in that mirror that every person that's got this uniform

191
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:05,584
will get my back! - Here we go again. I'm not like you

192
00:14:05,793 --> 00:14:09,212
No, you don't have to be like me.
But you're more than... yes you are

193
00:14:09,338 --> 00:14:11,298
Will you excuse me, I'm a little bit distracted here

194
00:14:11,507 --> 00:14:14,718
No, you can't be distracted right now. Listen to me!

195
00:14:18,513 --> 00:14:21,557
BAGRAM AIR BASE, AFGHANISTAN

196
00:14:30,857 --> 00:14:31,941
General

197
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,651
Welcome, Mr. Stark

198
00:14:34,152 --> 00:14:36,987
We look forward to your weapons presentation

199
00:14:38,614 --> 00:14:41,241
Is it better to be feared or respected?

200
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:44,869
And I say, is it too much to ask for both?

201
00:14:45,662 --> 00:14:48,456
With that in mind, I humbly present the crown jewel

202
00:14:48,665 --> 00:14:51,459
of Stark Industries freedom line.
It's the first missile system

203
00:14:51,668 --> 00:14:54,587
to incorporate our proprietary repulsor technology

204
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,548
They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire

205
00:14:58,841 --> 00:15:00,717
I respectfully disagree

206
00:15:00,926 --> 00:15:04,804
I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once

207
00:15:05,013 --> 00:15:08,724
That's how dad did it, that's how America does it...

208
00:15:08,933 --> 00:15:11,226
and it's worked out pretty well so far

209
00:15:11,435 --> 00:15:14,104
Find an excuse to let one of these off the chain

210
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,022
and I personally guarantee you

211
00:15:16,231 --> 00:15:19,442
the bad guys won't even want to come out of their caves

212
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:41,962
For your consideration, the Jericho

213
00:15:53,473 --> 00:15:56,809
We throw one of these in with
every purchase of 500 million or more

214
00:15:57,018 --> 00:15:58,519
To peace!

215
00:15:59,437 --> 00:16:01,313
- Tony.
- Obie, what are you doing up?

216
00:16:01,522 --> 00:16:03,857
I couldn't sleep till I found out how it went.
How did it go?

217
00:16:04,066 --> 00:16:06,276
Went great, looks like it's gonna be an early Christmas

218
00:16:06,484 --> 00:16:09,528
Hey, way to go, my boy. I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

219
00:16:09,737 --> 00:16:11,697
Why aren't you wearing those pyjamas I got you?

220
00:16:11,823 --> 00:16:13,407
Good night, Tony

221
00:16:14,492 --> 00:16:15,659
Hey Tony!

222
00:16:15,868 --> 00:16:19,162
I'm sorry, this is the fun-vee. The hum-drum-vee is back there

223
00:16:19,496 --> 00:16:22,123
- Nice job.
- See you back at base

224
00:17:28,808 --> 00:17:31,060
I wouldn't do that if I were you

225
00:18:07,634 --> 00:18:10,052
What the hell did you do to me?

226
00:18:10,345 --> 00:18:12,388
What I did?

227
00:18:12,681 --> 00:18:14,682
What I did is to save your life

228
00:18:14,891 --> 00:18:18,310
I removed all the shrapnel I could, but there's a lot left

229
00:18:18,477 --> 00:18:21,020
and it's headed into your atrial septum

230
00:18:21,188 --> 00:18:23,022
Here, wanna see?

231
00:18:23,607 --> 00:18:26,401
I have a souvenir. Take a look

232
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:31,405
I've seen many wounds like that in my village

233
00:18:31,614 --> 00:18:33,615
We call them the walking dead

234
00:18:34,033 --> 00:18:37,035
Because in takes about a week for the balls to reach the vital organs

235
00:18:37,244 --> 00:18:40,204
- What is this?
- That is an electromagnet

236
00:18:40,706 --> 00:18:42,749
Hooked up to a car battery

237
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:46,419
And it's keeping the shrapnel from entering your heart

238
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:56,427
That's right. Smile!

239
00:18:57,888 --> 00:18:59,472
We met once, you know

240
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:01,933
At the technical conference in Bern

241
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:04,977
- Don't remember.
- No, you wouldn't

242
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:08,522
If I had been that drunk,
I wouldn't have been able to stand

243
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,775
much less give a lecture on integrated circuits

244
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,818
Where are we?

245
00:19:15,111 --> 00:19:17,321
Come on, stand up. Stand up

246
00:19:18,406 --> 00:19:20,074
Do as I do

247
00:19:20,366 --> 00:19:22,367
C'mon, put your hands up

248
00:19:24,453 --> 00:19:26,454
Those are my guns. How did they get my guns?

249
00:19:26,663 --> 00:19:28,664
Do you understand me? Do as I do

250
00:19:48,975 --> 00:19:51,227
He says: "Welcome Tony Stark

251
00:19:51,436 --> 00:19:55,064
the most famous mass murderer in the history of America."

252
00:19:58,609 --> 00:20:00,152
He is honored

253
00:20:02,612 --> 00:20:04,989
He wants you to build a missile

254
00:20:05,698 --> 00:20:08,325
The Jericho missile that you demonstrated

255
00:20:11,745 --> 00:20:13,413
This one

256
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:19,627
I refuse

257
00:20:29,636 --> 00:20:30,845
Tony!

258
00:21:20,724 --> 00:21:23,309
He wants to know what you think

259
00:21:23,977 --> 00:21:26,479
I think he got a lot of my weapons

260
00:21:34,778 --> 00:21:39,031
He says they have everything you need to build a Jericho missile

261
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:42,117
He wants you to make the list of materials

262
00:21:45,287 --> 00:21:47,872
He says for you to start working immediately

263
00:21:48,082 --> 00:21:50,584
and when you're done, he will set you free

264
00:21:54,421 --> 00:21:55,922
No, I won't

265
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:57,631
No, he won't

266
00:22:10,477 --> 00:22:13,020
I'm sure they're looking for you, Stark

267
00:22:13,312 --> 00:22:16,439
But they will never find you in these mountains

268
00:22:17,942 --> 00:22:19,318
Look...

269
00:22:20,611 --> 00:22:24,447
What you just saw... that is your legacy, Stark

270
00:22:26,074 --> 00:22:29,493
Your life's work in the hands of those murderers

271
00:22:29,702 --> 00:22:31,954
Is that how you want to go out?

272
00:22:32,496 --> 00:22:37,500
Is this the last act of defiance of the great Tony Stark?

273
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:40,378
Or are you going to do something about it?

274
00:22:40,587 --> 00:22:43,589
Why should I do anything? They're gonna kill me, you...

275
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:47,426
Either way, if they don't, I'll probably be dead in a week

276
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:52,722
Well then... this is a very important week for you, isn't it?

277
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,685
If this is gonna be my workstation

278
00:22:57,894 --> 00:22:59,979
I want it well lit, I want all of these tools

279
00:23:00,188 --> 00:23:02,690
Welding gear, I don't care if it's acetylene or propane

280
00:23:02,857 --> 00:23:04,817
I need a soldering station, I need helmets

281
00:23:05,025 --> 00:23:06,943
I need goggles, I would like a smelting cup

282
00:23:07,111 --> 00:23:09,488
I need two sets of precision tools

283
00:23:21,707 --> 00:23:23,625
How many languages do you speak?

284
00:23:23,834 --> 00:23:26,878
A lot. But apparently not enough for this place

285
00:23:27,087 --> 00:23:30,506
They speak Arabic, Urdu, Dari, Pashto

286
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,092
Mongolian, Farsi, Russian

287
00:23:33,509 --> 00:23:35,093
Who are these people?

288
00:23:35,302 --> 00:23:38,388
They are your loyal customers, sir

289
00:23:38,555 --> 00:23:41,390
They call themselves The Ten Rings

290
00:23:50,358 --> 00:23:52,401
You know, we might be more productive

291
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:55,612
If you include me in the planning process?
Aha

292
00:24:03,202 --> 00:24:05,245
Okay. We don't need this

293
00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:08,790
What is that?

294
00:24:10,292 --> 00:24:13,920
That's palladium, 0.15 grams. We need at least 1.6

295
00:24:14,129 --> 00:24:17,131
so why don't you go break down the other eleven

296
00:24:19,133 --> 00:24:21,134
What are they doing?

297
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,344
Working

298
00:24:33,354 --> 00:24:36,231
Careful. Careful, we only get one shot at this

299
00:24:36,566 --> 00:24:39,068
Relax, I've steady hands

300
00:24:39,902 --> 00:24:42,487
Why do you think you're still alive, huh?

301
00:24:48,701 --> 00:24:50,702
What do I call you?

302
00:24:50,995 --> 00:24:54,581
- My name is Yinsen.
- Yinsen... nice to meet you

303
00:24:55,708 --> 00:24:57,709
Nice to meet you too

304
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:40,038
Wow, that doesn't look like a Jericho missile

305
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:43,125
That's because it is a miniaturized Arc reactor

306
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:46,670
We got a big one powering my factory at home

307
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,672
It should keep the shrapnel out of my heart

308
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,674
But what could it generate?

309
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:54,468
If my math is right, and it always is...

310
00:25:54,677 --> 00:25:56,595
three gigajoules per second

311
00:25:56,762 --> 00:26:00,431
That could run your heart for the 50 lifetimes.
Yeah

312
00:26:00,724 --> 00:26:03,017
Or something big for 50 minutes

313
00:26:11,692 --> 00:26:14,277
This is our ticket outta here.
What is it?

314
00:26:16,071 --> 00:26:18,656
'Flying the mountain' look

315
00:26:24,495 --> 00:26:25,996
Impressive

316
00:26:51,186 --> 00:26:52,979
Shesh Besh

317
00:26:54,189 --> 00:26:57,191
Good roll. Good roll

318
00:26:57,608 --> 00:26:59,609
You still didn't tell me where you're from

319
00:26:59,777 --> 00:27:02,320
I'm from a small town called Gulmira

320
00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:04,822
It's actually a nice place

321
00:27:05,032 --> 00:27:07,534
- You got a family?
- Yes

322
00:27:07,951 --> 00:27:11,203
And I will see them when I leave here

323
00:27:11,412 --> 00:27:13,413
And you, Stark?

324
00:27:16,834 --> 00:27:17,876
Nothing

325
00:27:18,961 --> 00:27:20,003
No

326
00:27:21,171 --> 00:27:25,508
So you're a man who has everything... and nothing

327
00:28:11,383 --> 00:28:14,218
Doesn't look anything like the photo

328
00:28:14,427 --> 00:28:16,136
Maybe he modified it

329
00:28:16,304 --> 00:28:19,348
- The tail doesn't seem right.
- Well, too bad

330
00:29:04,388 --> 00:29:05,931
Relax

331
00:29:14,689 --> 00:29:19,860
The bow and arrow once was
the pinnacle of weapons technology

332
00:29:22,238 --> 00:29:25,032
It allowed the great Genghis Khan

333
00:29:25,324 --> 00:29:28,535
to rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine

334
00:29:29,369 --> 00:29:32,538
An empire twice the size of Alexander the Great

335
00:29:34,082 --> 00:29:37,293
And four times the size of the Roman empire

336
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:43,214
But today

337
00:29:43,423 --> 00:29:46,967
whoever holds the latest Stark weapons

338
00:29:47,927 --> 00:29:49,928
rules these lands

339
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:54,099
And soon...

340
00:29:56,268 --> 00:29:58,353
...it will be my turn

341
00:30:11,198 --> 00:30:13,158
Why did you fail me?

342
00:30:13,659 --> 00:30:16,786
We're working on it. Diligently

343
00:30:17,203 --> 00:30:19,246
I spared your life

344
00:30:21,374 --> 00:30:23,417
Is this how you repay me?

345
00:30:24,001 --> 00:30:26,336
It's very complex

346
00:30:26,754 --> 00:30:28,880
We're trying hard

347
00:30:29,298 --> 00:30:31,091
On your knees

348
00:30:35,094 --> 00:30:37,054
You think I'm an idiot?

349
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:39,056
Tell me the truth

350
00:30:39,432 --> 00:30:41,517
We are working hard

351
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,815
Open your mouth

352
00:30:50,024 --> 00:30:53,026
- What does he want?
- You think I'm a fool?

353
00:30:56,864 --> 00:30:58,657
What is going on?

354
00:30:58,949 --> 00:31:01,201
Tell me the truth

355
00:31:01,994 --> 00:31:03,751
We are working on Jericho

356
00:31:03,751 --> 00:31:04,563
Tell me the truth

357
00:31:04,609 --> 00:31:06,121
We are working on Jericho

358
00:31:06,122 --> 00:31:08,332
What do you want, a delivery date?

359
00:31:15,714 --> 00:31:17,215
I need him

360
00:31:19,551 --> 00:31:21,552
He's a good assistant

361
00:31:25,848 --> 00:31:27,849
You have till tomorrow...

362
00:31:28,184 --> 00:31:30,185
...to assemble my missile

363
00:32:34,451 --> 00:32:35,910
- Okay?
- Yes

364
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:37,411
Can you move?

365
00:32:37,662 --> 00:32:39,163
Say it again

366
00:32:39,372 --> 00:32:41,206
41 steps straight ahead

367
00:32:41,374 --> 00:32:43,584
then 16 steps, left from the door, four to the right

368
00:32:43,793 --> 00:32:45,586
33 steps, turn right

369
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:54,552
Where is Stark?

370
00:32:54,761 --> 00:32:56,679
He was here a moment ago

371
00:32:56,888 --> 00:32:58,264
Go find him!

372
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:14,486
Yinsen!

373
00:33:14,696 --> 00:33:16,072
Yinsen! Stark!

374
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,739
Say something

375
00:33:17,948 --> 00:33:19,866
He is speaking Hungarian, I don't...

376
00:33:20,075 --> 00:33:21,868
- Speak Hungarian.
- Okay...

377
00:33:22,077 --> 00:33:23,745
What do you know?

378
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:49,017
- How did that work?
- Oh my goodness

379
00:33:49,226 --> 00:33:51,060
- It worked all right.
- What do I do?

380
00:33:51,228 --> 00:33:53,980
- Let me finish this.
- Finish last powering sequence

381
00:33:54,189 --> 00:33:55,315
Okay

382
00:33:55,816 --> 00:33:57,692
Now! Tell me, tell me!

383
00:33:57,901 --> 00:34:00,570
F11. Tell me when you see a progress bar

384
00:34:00,737 --> 00:34:02,488
It should be up right now

385
00:34:02,697 --> 00:34:04,698
Talk to me, tell me when you see it.
I have it

386
00:34:04,907 --> 00:34:06,199
- Press Ctrl + I.
- Got it

387
00:34:06,408 --> 00:34:09,452
'Enter'. I, 'Enter'. Come over here and button me up

388
00:34:13,873 --> 00:34:15,958
They are coming!

389
00:34:16,167 --> 00:34:18,210
Doesn't need to look pretty, just get it done

390
00:34:18,419 --> 00:34:19,878
They are coming

391
00:34:21,297 --> 00:34:24,049
Make sure that checkpoints are clear before you follow me out, OK?

392
00:34:24,258 --> 00:34:25,717
We need more time

393
00:34:26,718 --> 00:34:27,844
Okay

394
00:34:28,553 --> 00:34:30,179
I'm gonna go buy you some time

395
00:34:30,347 --> 00:34:31,764
Stick to the plan!

396
00:34:32,765 --> 00:34:34,474
Stick to the plan!

397
00:34:35,893 --> 00:34:37,352
Yinsen!

398
00:37:29,757 --> 00:37:31,800
- Yinsen!
- Watch out!

399
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:48,398
Stark

400
00:37:49,691 --> 00:37:51,734
Come on. We gotta go

401
00:37:52,444 --> 00:37:55,655
Move with me.
C'mon, we got a plan, we need to stick to it

402
00:37:55,864 --> 00:37:57,657
This was always the plan, Stark

403
00:37:57,865 --> 00:38:00,867
Come on, you're going to go see your family again

404
00:38:01,535 --> 00:38:04,287
My family is dead

405
00:38:04,455 --> 00:38:06,873
I'm going to see them now, Stark

406
00:38:09,042 --> 00:38:11,377
It's okay. It's okay

407
00:38:12,462 --> 00:38:15,506
I want this. I want this

408
00:38:21,553 --> 00:38:23,554
Thank you for saving me

409
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:28,184
Don't waste it. Don't waste your life

410
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,221
My turn

411
00:40:52,563 --> 00:40:54,064
Not bad

412
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:51,366
How was the fun-vee?

413
00:41:53,951 --> 00:41:56,703
Next time you ride with me, okay?

414
00:42:27,523 --> 00:42:29,524
Watch it coming up here

415
00:42:31,068 --> 00:42:34,070
Are you kidding me with this? Get rid of them

416
00:42:42,161 --> 00:42:43,662
Your eyes are red

417
00:42:43,871 --> 00:42:45,664
Few tears for your long lost boss?

418
00:42:45,873 --> 00:42:48,708
Tears of joy. I hate job hunting

419
00:42:48,917 --> 00:42:50,751
Yeah, vacation's over

420
00:42:51,962 --> 00:42:53,171
Where to, sir?

421
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,965
Take us to the hospital, please.
No. No? Tony...

422
00:42:56,174 --> 00:42:58,801
- You have to go to the hospital.
- I don't have to do anything

423
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:01,637
I was in captivity for three months.
There are two things I want to do

424
00:43:01,846 --> 00:43:04,056
I want an American cheeseburger...

425
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:06,141
...and the other one...
That's not going to happen

426
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:08,602
It's not what you think.
I want you to call for a press conference now

427
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:10,853
Call for a press conference? What on earth for?

428
00:43:11,062 --> 00:43:13,063
Yeah, Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first

429
00:43:24,824 --> 00:43:26,658
Look at this!

430
00:43:28,328 --> 00:43:29,579
Tony!

431
00:43:31,872 --> 00:43:34,040
I thought you'll be in a hospital

432
00:43:34,875 --> 00:43:36,334
Look at you!

433
00:43:36,793 --> 00:43:38,836
Oh, burger, you had to have a burger

434
00:43:39,004 --> 00:43:40,547
Did you get me one of those?

435
00:43:40,755 --> 00:43:42,756
There was only one left, I needed it

436
00:43:44,884 --> 00:43:46,885
Hey, look who's here!

437
00:43:52,933 --> 00:43:54,476
- Ms. Potts?
- Yes

438
00:43:54,684 --> 00:43:56,185
May I speak with you for a moment?

439
00:43:56,394 --> 00:43:59,271
I'm not part of the press conference,
but it's about to begin right now

440
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,732
I am not a reporter. I'm agent Phil Coulson

441
00:44:01,941 --> 00:44:03,901
with the Strategic Homeland Intervention

442
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:05,903
Enforcement and Logistics Division

443
00:44:06,111 --> 00:44:08,905
- That's quite a mouthful.
- I know. We're working on it

444
00:44:09,114 --> 00:44:13,117
We've been approached already by the DOD, FBI, CIA...

445
00:44:13,326 --> 00:44:16,870
We are a separate division. With a more specific focus

446
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:20,290
We need to debrief Mr. Stark about the circumstances of his escape

447
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:23,418
- I'll put something in a book, shell I?
- Thank you

448
00:44:28,965 --> 00:44:31,675
Hey, would it be alright if everyone sat down?

449
00:44:31,884 --> 00:44:34,886
Will you sit down?
That way you can see me, and I can...

450
00:44:35,179 --> 00:44:37,222
A little less formal...

451
00:44:42,144 --> 00:44:43,770
What's up with the lovin'?

452
00:44:43,979 --> 00:44:46,481
Don't look at me, I don't know what he's up to

453
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:49,317
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you

454
00:44:49,525 --> 00:44:52,027
I never got to say goodbye to dad

455
00:44:52,236 --> 00:44:54,988
I never got to say goodbye to my father

456
00:44:58,617 --> 00:45:00,660
There's questions that I would've asked him

457
00:45:00,869 --> 00:45:04,121
I would've asked him how he felt about what his company did...

458
00:45:04,539 --> 00:45:07,499
...if he was conflicted, if he ever had doubts

459
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:12,295
Or maybe he was every inch of a man
we all remember from the newsreels

460
00:45:16,966 --> 00:45:19,801
I saw young Americans killed...

461
00:45:20,178 --> 00:45:24,515
...by the very weapons I created to defend them and protect them

462
00:45:25,516 --> 00:45:28,977
And I saw that I had become part of a system

463
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:32,521
that is comfortable with zero-accountability

464
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:37,525
What happened over there?

465
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:39,862
I had my eyes opened

466
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:43,323
I came to realize that I have more to offer

467
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:46,576
this world than just making things that blow up

468
00:45:46,743 --> 00:45:50,037
And that is why, effective immediately, I'm shutting down

469
00:45:50,246 --> 00:45:53,582
the weapons manufacturing division of Stark International...

470
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:56,501
...untill such a time, as I can decide

471
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:58,711
what the future of this company will be

472
00:45:58,921 --> 00:46:01,590
what direction it should take, the one I'm comfortable with

473
00:46:01,798 --> 00:46:05,634
and is consistent with the highest good of this country and the world

474
00:46:06,969 --> 00:46:09,804
What we should take away from this...

475
00:46:09,972 --> 00:46:11,973
...is that Tony's back!

476
00:46:12,391 --> 00:46:14,809
And he's healthier than ever

477
00:46:15,143 --> 00:46:18,312
We are gonna have a little internal discussion

478
00:46:18,521 --> 00:46:21,356
and we'll get back to you with a follow-up

479
00:46:22,984 --> 00:46:25,236
- Where is he?
- He's inside

480
00:46:36,329 --> 00:46:38,706
That... that went well

481
00:46:38,915 --> 00:46:41,417
Did I just paint a target on the back of my head?

482
00:46:41,625 --> 00:46:43,585
Your head? What about my head?

483
00:46:43,794 --> 00:46:47,046
What do you think the over-under on a stock drop is gonna be?

484
00:46:47,255 --> 00:46:50,257
- Optimistically? 40 Points?
- At minimum

485
00:46:51,926 --> 00:46:54,761
Tony, we're a weapons manufacturer

486
00:46:54,971 --> 00:46:57,640
Obie, I just... I don't want the body count to be up...

487
00:46:57,848 --> 00:47:00,600
That's what we do.
We're iron mongers, we make weapons

488
00:47:00,768 --> 00:47:02,602
My name is on facade of the building

489
00:47:02,769 --> 00:47:04,895
What we do keeps the world from falling into chaos

490
00:47:05,105 --> 00:47:06,773
Not based on what I saw

491
00:47:07,315 --> 00:47:08,774
We're not doing a good enough job

492
00:47:08,983 --> 00:47:10,567
We can do better, we're gonna do something else

493
00:47:10,651 --> 00:47:13,528
Oh, like what? You want us to make baby bottles?

494
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,658
I think we should take another look into Arc Reactor technology

495
00:47:17,866 --> 00:47:21,452
Oh, come on. The Arc Reactor, that's a publicity stunt!

496
00:47:21,661 --> 00:47:25,039
Tony, c'mon!
We built that thing to shut the hippies up!

497
00:47:25,248 --> 00:47:28,459
- It works.
- Yeah, as a science project

498
00:47:28,959 --> 00:47:32,420
The Arc was never cost-effective.
We knew that before we built it

499
00:47:32,629 --> 00:47:35,381
Arc Reactor technology, that's a dead end, right?

500
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:37,550
- Maybe.
- Am I right?

501
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:40,594
We haven't had a breakthrough in that, in what... 30 years

502
00:47:40,803 --> 00:47:42,763
That's what they say

503
00:47:44,765 --> 00:47:46,558
Could you have a lousier poker face?

504
00:47:46,767 --> 00:47:48,977
Just tell me, who told you?
Never mind who told me

505
00:47:49,186 --> 00:47:50,729
- Show me.
- Rhodey or Pepper

506
00:47:50,896 --> 00:47:52,897
- I wanna see it.
- Okay, Rhodey

507
00:48:06,076 --> 00:48:07,577
It works

508
00:48:11,372 --> 00:48:13,415
Listen to me, Tony

509
00:48:13,791 --> 00:48:15,667
We are a team, do you understand?

510
00:48:15,876 --> 00:48:18,378
There's nothing we can't do if we stick together

511
00:48:18,587 --> 00:48:20,213
like your father and I

512
00:48:20,422 --> 00:48:23,257
I'm sorry I didn't give you a heads up, okay? But if I had...

513
00:48:23,466 --> 00:48:27,052
Tony, no more of this 'ready fire aim' business

514
00:48:27,262 --> 00:48:29,889
- Do you understand me?
- That was dad's line

515
00:48:30,514 --> 00:48:32,432
You gotta let me handle this

516
00:48:32,641 --> 00:48:35,018
We're gonna have to play whole different kind of ball now

517
00:48:35,227 --> 00:48:37,020
We're gonna have to take a lot of heat

518
00:48:37,229 --> 00:48:40,315
I want you to promise me that you're gonna lay low

519
00:48:40,607 --> 00:48:45,069
<i>Stark Industries. I've got one recommendation.
Ready, ready?</i>

520
00:48:45,736 --> 00:48:47,070
<i>Sell, sell, sell!</i>

521
00:48:47,279 --> 00:48:49,072
<i>Abandon ship!</i>

522
00:48:49,406 --> 00:48:52,325
<i>Does the 'Hindenburg' ring any bells?</i>

523
00:48:53,702 --> 00:48:57,914
<i>Let me show you the new Stark Industries business plan!</i>

524
00:49:00,166 --> 00:49:04,002
<i>Look, that's a weapons company that doesn't make weapons!</i>

525
00:49:04,712 --> 00:49:07,547
Pepper! How big are your hands?

526
00:49:07,756 --> 00:49:10,258
- What?
- How big are your hands?

527
00:49:10,467 --> 00:49:13,302
- I don't understand why...
- Get down here. I need you

528
00:49:20,517 --> 00:49:21,643
Hey!

529
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,605
Let's see them. Show me your hands

530
00:49:25,856 --> 00:49:27,315
Let's see them

531
00:49:27,649 --> 00:49:30,443
Oh, wow, they are small. Very petite, indeed

532
00:49:30,652 --> 00:49:33,070
I just need your help for a sec

533
00:49:33,863 --> 00:49:36,365
Oh my God, is that the thing that's keeping you alive?

534
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:38,783
It was, it is now an antique

535
00:49:39,368 --> 00:49:42,328
This is what will be keeping me alive for the foreseeable future

536
00:49:42,537 --> 00:49:44,538
I was swapping it up for an upgraded unit

537
00:49:44,747 --> 00:49:47,082
and I just ran into a little... speed bump

538
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:48,793
Speed bump? What's happening?

539
00:49:49,001 --> 00:49:50,585
It's nothing, it's just a little snag

540
00:49:50,753 --> 00:49:53,171
There's an exposed wire under this device

541
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:55,048
and is contacting a socket wall

542
00:49:55,257 --> 00:49:57,258
and is causing a little bit of a short circuit

543
00:49:59,219 --> 00:50:00,511
What do you want me to do?

544
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,180
Put that on the table over there. That is irrelevant

545
00:50:03,389 --> 00:50:04,848
I just want you to reach in...

546
00:50:05,057 --> 00:50:07,559
and you're just gonna gently lift the wire out

547
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:09,602
Is it safe?

548
00:50:09,812 --> 00:50:11,646
Yeah, it should be fine. It's just like an operation

549
00:50:11,813 --> 00:50:13,314
you just don't let it touch the socket wall

550
00:50:13,523 --> 00:50:16,233
- What's Operator
- It's just a game, never mind

551
00:50:16,442 --> 00:50:20,070
- Just gently lift the wire.
- Okay. Okay? Great

552
00:50:22,156 --> 00:50:24,699
You know, I don't think that I am qualified to do this

553
00:50:24,908 --> 00:50:27,451
No, no, you're fine. You're the most capable

554
00:50:27,661 --> 00:50:30,747
qualified and trustworthy person I've ever met

555
00:50:30,955 --> 00:50:32,748
You're gonna do great

556
00:50:33,541 --> 00:50:37,210
Is it too much of a problem to ask? Cause I really need your help here

557
00:50:44,092 --> 00:50:46,052
- Oh, there's pus!
- It's not pus

558
00:50:46,261 --> 00:50:51,015
It's a plasmic discharge, it's from the device, not from my body

559
00:50:51,307 --> 00:50:53,392
- It smells!
- Yeah, it does

560
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:55,685
The copper wire

561
00:50:55,894 --> 00:50:58,146
The copper wire, you got it?
I got it

562
00:50:58,355 --> 00:50:59,772
Now don't let it touch...

563
00:51:00,232 --> 00:51:03,234
...the sides, that's what I was trying to tell you before

564
00:51:03,568 --> 00:51:05,444
Okay, now make sure that when you pull it out

565
00:51:05,611 --> 00:51:07,946
you don't pull out the magnet and the end of it. That was it...

566
00:51:08,155 --> 00:51:11,157
...that you just pulled out.
Oh God. OK, what do I do?

567
00:51:11,408 --> 00:51:13,451
- Don't put it back in!
- What's wrong?

568
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:15,745
Nothing, I'm just going into cardiac arrest cause you yanked out...

569
00:51:15,954 --> 00:51:19,165
- What? I thought you said this was safe!
- We gotta hurry

570
00:51:19,165 --> 00:51:21,625
Take this, you gotta switch, real quick.
Okay, okay

571
00:51:22,001 --> 00:51:26,213
Tony, it's gonna be okay. I'm gonna make this okay

572
00:51:27,506 --> 00:51:30,049
You gotta touch that to base plate

573
00:51:30,258 --> 00:51:32,051
And make sure you...

574
00:51:35,847 --> 00:51:37,223
Was that so hard?

575
00:51:37,432 --> 00:51:39,850
That was fun, right? I got it, I got it

576
00:51:40,518 --> 00:51:41,518
Nice

577
00:51:41,727 --> 00:51:43,853
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I feel great

578
00:51:44,062 --> 00:51:45,688
Are you okay?

579
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:49,233
Don't ever, ever...

580
00:51:49,401 --> 00:51:52,403
...ever ask me to do anything like that ever again

581
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:55,238
I don't have anyone but you

582
00:52:00,452 --> 00:52:01,869
Are we ready?

583
00:52:07,292 --> 00:52:09,460
What do you want me to do with this?

584
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:13,546
That? Destroy it. Incinerate it

585
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,799
You don't wanna keep it?

586
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,801
Pepper, I've been called many things

587
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,803
Nostalgic is not one of them

588
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:24,974
- Would that be all, Mr. Stark?
- That would be all, Ms. Potts

589
00:52:25,683 --> 00:52:27,517
Hey butterfingers, come here

590
00:52:27,685 --> 00:52:29,895
What's all this stuff doing on top of my desk?

591
00:52:30,104 --> 00:52:32,606
That's my phone, that's a picture of me and my dad...

592
00:52:32,814 --> 00:52:35,816
Right there. In garbage. All that stuff

593
00:52:42,073 --> 00:52:44,116
The future of air combat

594
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:46,576
Is it manned or unmanned?

595
00:52:46,869 --> 00:52:50,747
I tell you, in my experience, no unmanned aerial vehicle

596
00:52:50,914 --> 00:52:53,749
will ever trump a pilot's instinct

597
00:52:54,125 --> 00:52:57,169
his insight - that ability to look into a situation

598
00:52:57,378 --> 00:53:00,297
beyond the obvious and discern its outcome

599
00:53:00,506 --> 00:53:02,090
Or pilot's judgement

600
00:53:02,299 --> 00:53:04,926
Colonel, it's... why not a pilot without a plane?

601
00:53:05,135 --> 00:53:07,512
Look who fell outta the sky! Mr. Tony Stark

602
00:53:07,721 --> 00:53:09,222
Speaking about manned or unmanned

603
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:11,014
you gotta get him to tell you about the time he guessed wrong

604
00:53:11,224 --> 00:53:12,683
It's spring break, just remember that

605
00:53:12,892 --> 00:53:16,311
Spring break 1987, that lovely lady, what was his name?

606
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:17,729
Was it Ivan?

607
00:53:17,938 --> 00:53:20,315
Don't do that, they'll believe it. Don't do that

608
00:53:20,524 --> 00:53:23,193
Give us a couple of minutes, you guys

609
00:53:26,529 --> 00:53:27,988
- I'm surprised.
- Why?

610
00:53:28,197 --> 00:53:30,740
I swear I didn't expect to see you walking around so soon

611
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:32,910
I'm doing a little better than walking

612
00:53:33,118 --> 00:53:34,535
- Really?
- Yeah

613
00:53:35,204 --> 00:53:37,581
Rhodey, I'm working on something big

614
00:53:37,831 --> 00:53:41,042
I came to talk to you. I want you to be part of it

615
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:45,379
You're about to make a whole lotta people around here real happy

616
00:53:45,546 --> 00:53:49,215
cause that little stunt at the press conference, that was juicy

617
00:53:49,842 --> 00:53:54,054
This is not for the military. I'm not... it's different

618
00:53:54,262 --> 00:53:57,056
What, are you humanitarian now or something?

619
00:53:57,265 --> 00:53:58,974
I need you to listen to me

620
00:53:59,183 --> 00:54:02,602
No, what you need is time to get your mind right

621
00:54:04,229 --> 00:54:05,980
I'm serious

622
00:54:08,692 --> 00:54:10,652
It was nice seeing you, Tony

623
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:12,528
Thanks

624
00:54:20,536 --> 00:54:23,663
- Jarvis, are you up?
- For you sir, always

625
00:54:23,997 --> 00:54:27,666
I'd like to open a new project file, index as: Mark 2

626
00:54:29,002 --> 00:54:32,380
Shell I store this on the Stark Industries' central database?

627
00:54:33,047 --> 00:54:35,716
I don't know who to trust right now.
Till further notice

628
00:54:35,883 --> 00:54:38,552
why don't we just keep everything on my private server

629
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:41,429
Working on a secret project, are we, sir?

630
00:54:45,141 --> 00:54:47,768
I don't want this winding up in the wrong hands

631
00:54:50,271 --> 00:54:53,065
Maybe in mine it could actually do some good

632
00:55:35,895 --> 00:55:37,187
Next

633
00:55:38,188 --> 00:55:39,397
Up

634
00:55:39,606 --> 00:55:42,358
Not the boot, Dummy, right here. You got me?

635
00:55:42,567 --> 00:55:44,443
Stay put. Nice

636
00:55:45,945 --> 00:55:48,822
And you, you're no better at it at all. Lift... I got it

637
00:55:50,575 --> 00:55:52,701
Okay, I'm sorry, am I in your way?

638
00:55:59,499 --> 00:56:00,499
Up

639
00:56:01,501 --> 00:56:04,128
That's great, don't even move

640
00:56:04,504 --> 00:56:07,047
You... are a tragedy

641
00:56:16,556 --> 00:56:18,766
Okay, lets do this right

642
00:56:19,434 --> 00:56:22,561
Start mark, half meter back of the center

643
00:56:25,189 --> 00:56:27,524
Dummy, look for light. Stand back for fire safety

644
00:56:27,691 --> 00:56:29,525
You, roll it

645
00:56:33,863 --> 00:56:35,864
Activate hand controls

646
00:56:39,243 --> 00:56:41,036
We are gonna start up nice and easy

647
00:56:41,245 --> 00:56:43,455
raising 10% thrust capacity to achieve lift

648
00:56:43,956 --> 00:56:47,959
And 3, 2, 1

649
00:57:26,243 --> 00:57:28,495
Up two? Alright, step back

650
00:57:28,704 --> 00:57:30,830
I've been buzzing you.
Did you hear the intercom?

651
00:57:30,998 --> 00:57:32,624
Yeah, everything's... what?

652
00:57:32,833 --> 00:57:35,793
- Obadiah's upstairs.
- Great, I'll be right up

653
00:57:38,379 --> 00:57:40,547
I thought you said you were done making weapons?

654
00:57:40,756 --> 00:57:43,591
It isn't. This is a flight stabilizer

655
00:57:43,801 --> 00:57:45,677
It's completely harmless

656
00:57:49,639 --> 00:57:51,473
I didn't expect that

657
00:57:56,103 --> 00:57:57,729
How'd it go?

658
00:57:59,773 --> 00:58:01,733
Oh, went that bad huh?

659
00:58:01,942 --> 00:58:04,527
Just because I brought pizza back from New York

660
00:58:04,736 --> 00:58:07,947
doesn't mean it went bad.
Sure doesn't. Oh, boy

661
00:58:08,281 --> 00:58:10,491
It would've gone better if you were there

662
00:58:11,451 --> 00:58:13,828
You told me to lay low and that's what I've been doing

663
00:58:14,036 --> 00:58:15,662
I lay low and you take care of all the...

664
00:58:15,871 --> 00:58:17,872
Hey, c'mon. In public, the press...

665
00:58:18,415 --> 00:58:20,667
This was a Board of Directors meeting

666
00:58:20,876 --> 00:58:23,336
This was a Board of Directors meeting?

667
00:58:24,254 --> 00:58:26,172
The Board is claiming a Post Traumatic Stress

668
00:58:26,381 --> 00:58:28,466
They are filing an injunction. - A what?

669
00:58:28,674 --> 00:58:30,050
They wanna lock you out

670
00:58:30,259 --> 00:58:32,302
Why, cause the stocks dip 40 points?
We knew this was gonna happen

671
00:58:32,511 --> 00:58:34,512
- 56 and a half.
- It doesn't matter

672
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,806
We own a controlling interest in the company

673
00:58:37,015 --> 00:58:39,558
Tony, the Board has rights too

674
00:58:40,101 --> 00:58:43,687
They are making the case that you and your new direction

675
00:58:43,896 --> 00:58:45,730
isn't in a company's best interest

676
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:48,025
I'm being responsible. That's a new direction

677
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:50,067
For me... for the company

678
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:54,071
I mean, me on the company's behalf
being responsible for the way that...

679
00:58:54,406 --> 00:58:57,700
- Oh, this is great!
- Oh c'mon, wait! Tony, Tony!

680
00:58:57,992 --> 00:59:00,994
- I'll be in the shop. - Hey, hey, Tony, listen

681
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:03,288
I'm trying to turn this thing around

682
00:59:03,497 --> 00:59:06,457
but you gotta give me something.
Something to pitch them

683
00:59:06,625 --> 00:59:09,210
Let me have the engineers analyze that, you know

684
00:59:09,419 --> 00:59:11,212
draw some specs.
No

685
00:59:11,421 --> 00:59:13,464
No. Absolutely not. This one stays with me

686
00:59:13,631 --> 00:59:15,382
That's it Obie. Forget it

687
00:59:15,591 --> 00:59:17,008
Alright, well this stays with me then

688
00:59:17,218 --> 00:59:20,012
Go on, here, you can have a piece.
Take two. Thank you

689
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:22,638
Do you mind if I come down there to see what you're doing?

690
00:59:22,848 --> 00:59:24,224
Good night, Obie

691
00:59:24,558 --> 00:59:27,685
Day 11, Test 37, Configuration 2.0

692
00:59:27,894 --> 00:59:30,729
For lack of a better option, Dummy is still on fire safety

693
00:59:30,938 --> 00:59:33,565
If you douse me again, and I'm not on fire

694
00:59:33,774 --> 00:59:36,693
I'm donating you to a city college. Alright, nice and easy

695
00:59:36,985 --> 00:59:41,614
Seriously, just gonna start off with 1% thrust capacity

696
00:59:43,408 --> 00:59:45,201
And 3, 2, 1

697
00:59:59,923 --> 01:00:01,966
Please don't follow me around with it either cause I feel

698
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:04,593
like I'm going to catch on fire spontaneously. Just stand down

699
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,469
If something happens, then come in

700
01:00:06,637 --> 01:00:09,848
Again, lets bring it up to 2.5%. 3, 2, 1...

701
01:00:25,946 --> 01:00:28,281
Okay, this is where I don't want to be

702
01:00:29,032 --> 01:00:30,908
Not the car, not the car

703
01:00:43,712 --> 01:00:45,713
It could be worse. We are fine

704
01:00:47,757 --> 01:00:49,883
Okay, we are getting there

705
01:01:09,443 --> 01:01:11,444
Yeah. I can fly

706
01:01:15,824 --> 01:01:18,242
- Jarvis, are you there?
- At your service, sir

707
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:21,037
Engage head up display. Check

708
01:01:21,245 --> 01:01:23,663
Import all preferences from home interface

709
01:01:23,831 --> 01:01:25,248
Will do, sir

710
01:01:31,296 --> 01:01:33,256
Alright, what do you say?

711
01:01:33,465 --> 01:01:36,050
I have indeed been uploaded, sir.
We're online and ready

712
01:01:36,259 --> 01:01:38,093
Start the virtual walkaround

713
01:01:38,302 --> 01:01:41,096
Importing preferences and calibrating virtual environment

714
01:01:41,305 --> 01:01:44,182
- Do a check on control surfaces.
- As you wish

715
01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:09,121
Test complete. Preparing to power down and begin diagnostics

716
01:02:09,288 --> 01:02:11,748
Ah, yes... tell you what. Do a weather and ATC check

717
01:02:11,957 --> 01:02:13,458
Start listening the ground control

718
01:02:13,625 --> 01:02:16,168
Sir, there are still terabytes of calculations needed

719
01:02:16,378 --> 01:02:18,338
before an actual flight.
Jarvis...

720
01:02:18,546 --> 01:02:21,173
Sometimes you gotta run before you can walk

721
01:02:21,341 --> 01:02:25,177
Ready? And 3, 2, 1

722
01:02:48,657 --> 01:02:50,700
It feels like a dream

723
01:03:18,631 --> 01:03:20,587
Alright, lets see what this thing can do

724
01:03:20,763 --> 01:03:22,415
What's the SR-71's record?

725
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:26,067
The altitude record for fixed-wing flight is 85.000 feet, sir

726
01:03:26,284 --> 01:03:28,719
Records are made to be broken. C'mon!

727
01:03:32,372 --> 01:03:35,851
Sir, there is a potentially fatal build-up of ice occurring

728
01:03:36,024 --> 01:03:37,459
Keep going!

729
01:03:38,894 --> 01:03:40,416
Higher!

730
01:03:54,634 --> 01:03:57,112
We're iced up, Jarvis! Deploy flaps

731
01:03:57,852 --> 01:03:59,330
Jarvis?

732
01:04:01,331 --> 01:04:03,548
C'mon, we gotta break the ice!

733
01:04:38,986 --> 01:04:40,420
Cut power

734
01:06:04,601 --> 01:06:08,036
Note: main transducer feels sluggish at plus 40 altitude

735
01:06:08,209 --> 01:06:10,209
The whole pressurization is problematic

736
01:06:10,427 --> 01:06:12,644
I'm thinking 'icy' is a probable factor

737
01:06:12,818 --> 01:06:15,731
A very astute observation, sir.
Perhaps if you intend to visit

738
01:06:15,906 --> 01:06:18,079
other planets, we should improve the exo systems

739
01:06:18,297 --> 01:06:20,819
Connect to the Cisco, have it reconfigure the shell metals

740
01:06:21,036 --> 01:06:23,862
Use the gold-titanium alloy from the Seraphim tactical satellite

741
01:06:24,081 --> 01:06:26,254
That should ensure the fuselage integrity

742
01:06:26,472 --> 01:06:28,688
while maintaining power-to-weight ratio. Got it?

743
01:06:28,863 --> 01:06:31,689
Yes. Shall I render using proposed specifications?

744
01:06:31,907 --> 01:06:33,385
Thrill me

745
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:36,559
<i>Tonight's red hot, red carpeted,</i>

746
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:38,732
<i>right here at the Disney Concert Hall,</i>

747
01:06:38,951 --> 01:06:41,733
<i>where Tony Stark's third annual benefit for</i>

748
01:06:41,951 --> 01:06:44,951
<i>the Firefighters Family Fund has become the place to be...</i>

749
01:06:45,212 --> 01:06:46,952
Jarvis, did we get an invite from them?

750
01:06:47,125 --> 01:06:49,516
I have no record of the invitation, sir

751
01:06:49,952 --> 01:06:51,821
<i>...haven't been seen in public</i>

752
01:06:51,995 --> 01:06:54,951
<i>since his bizarre and highly controversial press conference.</i>

753
01:06:55,170 --> 01:06:57,778
<i>Some claim he's suffering from PTS and has been</i>

754
01:06:57,996 --> 01:07:00,691
<i>bed ridden for weeks. Whatever the case may be,</i>

755
01:07:00,866 --> 01:07:03,866
<i>no one expects an appearance from him tonight.</i>

756
01:07:04,301 --> 01:07:05,735
The render is complete

757
01:07:06,257 --> 01:07:08,301
Little ostentatious, don't you think?

758
01:07:08,518 --> 01:07:11,561
What was I thinking? You're usually so discrete

759
01:07:12,867 --> 01:07:15,780
Tell you what... throw a little hot rot red in there

760
01:07:15,954 --> 01:07:18,388
Yes, that shall help you keep a low profile

761
01:07:21,824 --> 01:07:23,823
The render is complete

762
01:07:24,172 --> 01:07:26,171
Yeah, I like it. Fabricate it and paint it

763
01:07:26,346 --> 01:07:27,998
Commencing an automated assembly

764
01:07:28,215 --> 01:07:30,432
Estimated completion time is five hours

765
01:07:30,999 --> 01:07:33,042
Don't wait up for me, honey

766
01:07:56,305 --> 01:07:58,087
The weapons manufacturing is...

767
01:07:58,304 --> 01:08:01,695
only a one small part of what Stark Industries is all about...

768
01:08:06,784 --> 01:08:09,653
- Hey Tony, remember me?
- I sure don't

769
01:08:10,653 --> 01:08:12,479
You look great, Hef

770
01:08:15,306 --> 01:08:18,871
What's the world coming to when a guy's gotta crash his own party?

771
01:08:19,393 --> 01:08:21,001
Look at you!

772
01:08:22,176 --> 01:08:24,872
- Hey, what a surprise!
- I'll see you inside

773
01:08:26,915 --> 01:08:28,914
Listen, take it slow, alright?

774
01:08:29,089 --> 01:08:31,220
I got the Board where I really want them

775
01:08:31,437 --> 01:08:34,133
You got it. Just cabin fever, I'll just be a minute

776
01:08:38,873 --> 01:08:41,003
Give me a Scotch, I'm starving

777
01:08:42,004 --> 01:08:44,003
- Mr. Stark?
- Yeah?

778
01:08:44,264 --> 01:08:47,264
- Agent Coulson.
- Oh yeah, the guy from the...

779
01:08:47,526 --> 01:08:49,222
Strategic Homeland Intervention

780
01:08:49,395 --> 01:08:51,395
Enforcement and Logistics Division

781
01:08:51,526 --> 01:08:53,439
God, you got... you need a new name for that

782
01:08:53,613 --> 01:08:55,221
Yeah, I hear that a lot

783
01:08:55,657 --> 01:08:57,874
Listen, I know this must be a trying time for you

784
01:08:58,091 --> 01:08:59,656
but we need to debrief you

785
01:08:59,874 --> 01:09:01,874
There's still a lot of unanswered questions

786
01:09:02,092 --> 01:09:03,874
and time can be a factor with these things

787
01:09:04,092 --> 01:09:05,874
Lets just put something on the books

788
01:09:06,092 --> 01:09:09,092
How about the 24th, at 7 p.m. at Stark Industries?

789
01:09:09,788 --> 01:09:12,831
Tell you what... you got it. You're absolutely right

790
01:09:13,136 --> 01:09:17,354
Well... I'm gonna go to my assistant and we'll make it date

791
01:09:18,963 --> 01:09:20,962
You look fantastic, I didn't recognise you

792
01:09:21,181 --> 01:09:23,398
- What are you doing here?
- Avoiding government agents

793
01:09:23,572 --> 01:09:26,006
- Are you here by yourself?
- Where'd you get that dress?

794
01:09:26,181 --> 01:09:28,441
It was a birthday present from you, actually

795
01:09:28,615 --> 01:09:30,615
- I have great taste.
- Yes

796
01:09:30,790 --> 01:09:33,963
- You, uh, wanna dance?
- Oh, no, thank you. No

797
01:09:45,704 --> 01:09:47,704
Am I making you uncomfortable?

798
01:09:48,095 --> 01:09:49,486
No, no

799
01:09:50,096 --> 01:09:52,182
I always forget to wear a deodorant

800
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:54,704
and dance with my boss in front of everyone

801
01:09:54,922 --> 01:09:56,791
that I work with, in a dress with no back

802
01:09:57,617 --> 01:10:00,139
- You look great, you smell great.
- Oh, God

803
01:10:00,314 --> 01:10:02,487
But I could fire you, if that'd take the edge off

804
01:10:02,661 --> 01:10:05,748
I actually don't think that you could tie your shoes without me

805
01:10:05,967 --> 01:10:07,357
I'd make it a week

806
01:10:07,575 --> 01:10:10,357
Really? What's your social security number?

807
01:10:13,663 --> 01:10:15,314
- Five.
- Five?

808
01:10:16,923 --> 01:10:19,793
You're missing just a couple of digits there

809
01:10:20,011 --> 01:10:24,010
The other eight? That's why I got you, for the other eight

810
01:10:35,838 --> 01:10:38,881
- How about a little air?
- Yes, I need some air

811
01:10:40,882 --> 01:10:42,925
- That was totally weird.
- Totally harmless

812
01:10:43,144 --> 01:10:45,534
It was totally not harmless, by the way

813
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:48,838
- Nobody was watching us.
- Everybody who I work with...

814
01:10:49,056 --> 01:10:52,012
I think you lost objectivity.
I think they... we just danced

815
01:10:52,231 --> 01:10:54,056
No, it was not just the dance!

816
01:10:54,274 --> 01:10:56,056
You don't understand because you're you

817
01:10:56,274 --> 01:10:59,492
And everybody knows exactly who you are, and how you are with girls

818
01:10:59,709 --> 01:11:01,970
And all that, which is completely fine...

819
01:11:02,188 --> 01:11:05,362
But you know, then me, you're my boss and I'm dancing...

820
01:11:05,579 --> 01:11:08,884
Because it makes me look like... the one who's trying to...

821
01:11:09,058 --> 01:11:11,536
I just think you're overstating, that's all

822
01:11:11,753 --> 01:11:15,579
And we're here, and then I'm... wearing this ridiculous dress...

823
01:11:15,884 --> 01:11:19,058
And then we were dancing like that and...

824
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:34,450
- I would like a drink, please.
- Got it

825
01:11:36,494 --> 01:11:39,146
I would like a vodka martini, please

826
01:11:39,365 --> 01:11:42,061
Very dry with olives, lot of olives

827
01:11:42,278 --> 01:11:44,278
like at least three olives

828
01:11:45,104 --> 01:11:48,147
Two vodka martinis, extra dry, extra olives, extra fast

829
01:11:48,365 --> 01:11:49,973
Make one of them dirty

830
01:11:55,149 --> 01:11:58,496
- Well... Tony Stark!
- Oh, hey!

831
01:11:58,757 --> 01:12:00,539
Fancy seeing you here

832
01:12:04,105 --> 01:12:06,061
- Carrie.
- Christine. That's right

833
01:12:06,367 --> 01:12:08,801
You have a lot of nerve showing up here tonight

834
01:12:09,106 --> 01:12:11,193
Can I at least get a reaction from you?

835
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:13,192
Panic. I would say panic is my reaction

836
01:12:13,411 --> 01:12:15,193
I was referring to your company's involvement

837
01:12:15,410 --> 01:12:17,280
in this latest atrocity. - They just put my name

838
01:12:17,454 --> 01:12:18,446
on the invitation, I don't know what to tell you

839
01:12:18,515 --> 01:12:21,323
I actually almost bought it, hook, line and sinker

840
01:12:21,542 --> 01:12:23,802
I was out of town for a couple of months, in case you didn't hear

841
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:25,368
Is this what you call accountability?

842
01:12:25,715 --> 01:12:28,759
It's a town called Gulmira. Heard of it?

843
01:12:40,109 --> 01:12:42,891
- When were these taken?
- Yesterday

844
01:12:43,108 --> 01:12:45,499
- I didn't approve any shipment.
- Well, your company did

845
01:12:45,674 --> 01:12:47,500
Well, I'm not my company

846
01:12:48,326 --> 01:12:51,108
- Please, do you mind?
- Have you seen these pictures?

847
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:54,848
- What's going on?
- Tony, you can't afford to be this naive

848
01:12:55,066 --> 01:12:57,066
I was naive before, when they said:

849
01:12:57,283 --> 01:12:59,848
Here's the line, we don't cross it, this is how we do business

850
01:13:00,066 --> 01:13:03,196
If we're double-dealing under the table... are we?

851
01:13:08,023 --> 01:13:10,066
Let's take a picture. Come on

852
01:13:10,459 --> 01:13:11,937
Picture time!

853
01:13:13,850 --> 01:13:16,632
Tony... who do you think locked you out?

854
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:20,111
I was the one who filed the injunction against you

855
01:13:22,372 --> 01:13:24,850
It's the only way I can protect you

856
01:13:37,113 --> 01:13:39,895
<i>The fifteen miles hike to the outskirts of Gulmira</i>

857
01:13:40,112 --> 01:13:42,982
<i>can only be described as a 'descent into Hell'.</i>

858
01:13:43,157 --> 01:13:45,374
<i>Into a modern day heart of darkness.</i>

859
01:13:45,591 --> 01:13:48,156
<i>Simple farmers and herders from peaceful villages</i>

860
01:13:48,374 --> 01:13:50,200
<i>have been driven from their homes</i>

861
01:13:50,417 --> 01:13:52,417
<i>displaced from their lands by warlords,</i>

862
01:13:52,635 --> 01:13:54,417
<i>emboldened by a newfound power.</i>

863
01:13:54,722 --> 01:13:56,765
<i>Villagers have been forced to take shelter</i>

864
01:13:56,940 --> 01:13:58,983
<i>in whatever ways that they can find.</i>

865
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:00,940
<i>In the ruins of other villages</i>

866
01:14:01,288 --> 01:14:04,331
<i>or here, in the remnants of the old Soviet smelting plant.</i>

867
01:14:09,376 --> 01:14:11,984
<i>Recent violence has been attributed to a group</i>

868
01:14:11,984 --> 01:14:15,549
<i>of foreign fighters, referred to by locals as the Ten Rings.</i>

869
01:14:15,767 --> 01:14:18,985
<i>As you can see, these men are heavily armed and on a mission.</i>

870
01:14:19,202 --> 01:14:22,984
<i>A mission that can prove fatal to anyone who stands in their way.</i>

871
01:14:23,421 --> 01:14:26,246
<i>With no political will or international pressure,</i>

872
01:14:26,246 --> 01:14:28,637
<i>there's very little hope for these refugees.</i>

873
01:14:28,856 --> 01:14:31,855
<i>Around me, a woman begging for news on her husband</i>

874
01:14:32,073 --> 01:14:34,072
<i>who was kidnapped by insurgents.</i>

875
01:14:34,291 --> 01:14:35,855
<i>Either forced to join their militia...</i>

876
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:44,203
<i>...to anyone who will stop a child's simple question:</i>

877
01:14:44,422 --> 01:14:46,900
<i>"Where are my mother and father?"</i>

878
01:14:48,074 --> 01:14:50,552
<i>There's very little hope for these refugees,</i>

879
01:14:50,726 --> 01:14:54,682
<i>refugees who can only wonder who, if anyone, will help.</i>

880
01:16:27,429 --> 01:16:28,646
Faster!

881
01:16:28,864 --> 01:16:31,125
Women on the trucks! The weapons here!

882
01:16:31,342 --> 01:16:33,516
Abandon houses! Hurry up!

883
01:16:41,735 --> 01:16:43,474
Hold this rebel!

884
01:16:45,692 --> 01:16:47,909
Put him with the others

885
01:16:53,344 --> 01:16:54,648
Father!

886
01:16:58,823 --> 01:17:00,431
What the hell is this?

887
01:17:11,737 --> 01:17:13,476
Kill this bastard!

888
01:17:13,911 --> 01:17:15,563
You are incompetent!

889
01:17:18,781 --> 01:17:20,303
Turn your head!

890
01:17:21,781 --> 01:17:23,433
Father!

891
01:18:26,526 --> 01:18:28,307
He is all yours

892
01:19:25,051 --> 01:19:26,747
AIR BASE EDWARDS, CALIFORNIA

893
01:19:26,877 --> 01:19:28,746
- What the hell was that?
- Are we clear to go in there?

894
01:19:28,921 --> 01:19:30,138
No, sir. They were using human shields

895
01:19:30,356 --> 01:19:31,573
We never got the green light

896
01:19:31,791 --> 01:19:33,834
Department of State, they're gonna be all over this

897
01:19:34,791 --> 01:19:36,443
We got a bogey

898
01:19:36,617 --> 01:19:38,486
Is CIA on the line?

899
01:19:38,705 --> 01:19:40,792
I got them on line, they wanna know if it's us

900
01:19:40,965 --> 01:19:42,487
No, that definitely is not us, sir

901
01:19:42,661 --> 01:19:44,486
- It wasn't navy.
- Wasn't marines

902
01:19:44,661 --> 01:19:47,270
I need answers! Can I please get eyes on target?

903
01:19:48,575 --> 01:19:49,879
Get me colonel Rhodes

904
01:19:50,096 --> 01:19:52,487
from the Weapons development down here now!

905
01:19:58,053 --> 01:19:59,923
We ran an ID check and crossed reference

906
01:20:00,098 --> 01:20:01,923
with all known databases. We have nothing

907
01:20:02,141 --> 01:20:03,923
Any high-altitude surveillance in the region?

908
01:20:04,141 --> 01:20:05,923
We've got an AWAC and a Global Hawk in the area

909
01:20:06,141 --> 01:20:07,619
So this things just appeared out of nowhere?

910
01:20:07,837 --> 01:20:09,359
How come it didn't show up on the Radar?

911
01:20:09,532 --> 01:20:11,314
It's got a minimum Radar cross-section, sir

912
01:20:11,533 --> 01:20:13,358
- Is it stealth?
- No, sir. It's tiny

913
01:20:13,576 --> 01:20:15,707
We think it's an unmanned aerial vehicle

914
01:20:15,968 --> 01:20:18,446
Colonel, what are we dealing with here?

915
01:20:20,446 --> 01:20:22,316
I'm gonna make a call

916
01:20:27,012 --> 01:20:28,490
- Hello?
- Tony?

917
01:20:28,708 --> 01:20:30,448
- Who is this?
- It's Rhodes

918
01:20:30,621 --> 01:20:31,794
Sorry, hello?

919
01:20:31,969 --> 01:20:33,839
- I said it's Rhodes.
- Speak up, please

920
01:20:33,970 --> 01:20:37,187
- What the hell is that noise?
- I'm driving with the top down

921
01:20:37,404 --> 01:20:39,100
Yeah, well I need your help right now

922
01:20:39,317 --> 01:20:40,925
It's funny how that works, huh?

923
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:43,187
Yeah, speaking of funny, we got a weapons depot

924
01:20:43,361 --> 01:20:45,274
that was just blown up a few cliques from where

925
01:20:45,491 --> 01:20:47,273
you've been held captive.
Well, that's a hot spot

926
01:20:47,492 --> 01:20:50,100
Sounds like someone stepped in and did you job for you

927
01:20:50,275 --> 01:20:51,970
Why do you sound out of breath, Tony?

928
01:20:52,188 --> 01:20:54,187
- I was just jogging at the canyon.
- I thought you were driving

929
01:20:54,362 --> 01:20:56,362
Right, I was driving to the canyon where I'm gonna jog

930
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:58,362
Are you sure you don't have any tech in that area...

931
01:20:58,580 --> 01:20:59,796
...I should know about? - Nope

932
01:20:59,971 --> 01:21:01,623
Bogey spotted!

933
01:21:01,798 --> 01:21:03,885
Okay, good, cause I'm staring at one right now

934
01:21:04,102 --> 01:21:06,319
and it's about to be blown to kingdom come

935
01:21:13,886 --> 01:21:17,059
War room, this is Whiplash One.
I've got the bogey in my sight

936
01:21:17,582 --> 01:21:20,407
- Whiplash One, what is it?
- I've got no idea

937
01:21:20,495 --> 01:21:22,582
- You have radio contact?
- Non responsive, sir

938
01:21:22,799 --> 01:21:24,581
Then you are clear to engage

939
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:34,452
Bogey just went supersonic. I got a lock!

940
01:21:39,061 --> 01:21:41,060
Incoming missile.
Flairs!

941
01:21:43,844 --> 01:21:46,191
Wait a second! Bogey deployed flairs

942
01:22:00,671 --> 01:22:02,105
Deploy flaps!

943
01:22:03,454 --> 01:22:05,845
Holly... this thing just drove off the Radar, sir!

944
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:07,845
Satellite image has been lost

945
01:22:08,063 --> 01:22:10,410
- No way that's the U.A.V.
- What is it?

946
01:22:10,629 --> 01:22:12,454
I can't see anything

947
01:22:12,673 --> 01:22:15,151
Whatever it was, it just bought the farm

948
01:22:15,586 --> 01:22:17,629
I think bogey has been handled, sir

949
01:22:27,543 --> 01:22:29,630
- Hello?
- Hi, Rhodey, it's me. It's who?

950
01:22:29,847 --> 01:22:32,717
I'm sorry, it Is me. You asked what that was, and it was me

951
01:22:32,892 --> 01:22:35,630
No, see.. this isn't a game. You do not send civilian equipment

952
01:22:35,847 --> 01:22:38,238
into my active war zone. You understand that?

953
01:22:38,457 --> 01:22:41,891
It's not a piece of equipment.
I am in it. It's a suit. It's me!

954
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:44,239
Rhodey, you got anything for me?

955
01:22:46,110 --> 01:22:49,327
Mark your position and return to base. - Roger that

956
01:22:51,545 --> 01:22:54,632
On your belly! It looks like a... man!

957
01:22:54,849 --> 01:22:57,458
Shake him off! Move, move!

958
01:23:05,502 --> 01:23:07,502
I'm hit! I'm hit!

959
01:23:13,373 --> 01:23:15,155
Eject! Eject!

960
01:23:21,765 --> 01:23:23,590
Whiplash One down

961
01:23:23,764 --> 01:23:27,199
- Whiplash 2, do you see a chute?
- Negative! No chute! No chute!

962
01:23:33,113 --> 01:23:35,156
My chute's jammed!

963
01:23:39,853 --> 01:23:42,157
Sir, I've got a visual on a bogey

964
01:23:42,418 --> 01:23:45,896
Whiplash 2, reengage.
If you get a clear shot, you take it!

965
01:23:47,201 --> 01:23:50,157
Major, we don't even know what we're shooting at.
Call off the Raptors

966
01:23:50,418 --> 01:23:53,374
That thing just took out an F-22 inside the legal no-fly zone

967
01:23:53,505 --> 01:23:55,505
Whiplash 2, if you have a clear shot, take it

968
01:23:55,723 --> 01:23:58,202
They've been reengaged. Execute evasive maneuver

969
01:23:58,419 --> 01:23:59,592
Keep going!

970
01:24:06,941 --> 01:24:09,463
Got a chute! Got a chute!

971
01:24:16,507 --> 01:24:19,507
- Tony, are you still there?
- Hey, thanks

972
01:24:19,682 --> 01:24:22,508
Oh my God, you crazy son of a bitch!

973
01:24:22,725 --> 01:24:25,072
You owe me a plane, you know that, right?

974
01:24:26,030 --> 01:24:28,638
Yeah, well, technically he hit me, so...

975
01:24:28,856 --> 01:24:31,595
Now are you gonna come by and see what I'm working on?
No, no

976
01:24:31,770 --> 01:24:33,378
The less I know the better

977
01:24:33,595 --> 01:24:35,595
Now what am I supposed to tell to the press?

978
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:37,725
Training exercise. Isn't that the usual BS?

979
01:24:37,944 --> 01:24:39,726
It's not that simple

980
01:24:40,162 --> 01:24:42,117
An unfortunate training exercise

981
01:24:42,336 --> 01:24:45,162
involving an F-22 Raptor occurred yesterday

982
01:24:45,379 --> 01:24:48,423
I'm pleased to report that the pilot was not injured

983
01:24:49,032 --> 01:24:52,858
As for the unexpected turn of events on the ground in Gulmira

984
01:24:53,075 --> 01:24:56,596
it is still unclear who or what intervened

985
01:24:56,771 --> 01:25:00,597
but I can assure you that the U.S. government was not involved

986
01:25:05,772 --> 01:25:08,468
Oh, it isn't that bad, sir

987
01:25:08,729 --> 01:25:11,816
Sir, the more you struggle, the more this is going to hurt

988
01:25:11,990 --> 01:25:13,989
Be gentle, this is my first time

989
01:25:14,555 --> 01:25:16,511
I designed this to come off

990
01:25:20,991 --> 01:25:23,034
Please try not to move

991
01:25:24,121 --> 01:25:26,208
What's going on here?

992
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:34,079
Let's face it, this is not the worst thing you've caught me doing

993
01:25:35,383 --> 01:25:37,644
Are those bullet holes?

994
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:06,472
Welcome

995
01:26:09,385 --> 01:26:11,907
Compliments of Tony Stark

996
01:26:12,298 --> 01:26:15,863
If you killed him when you were supposed to, you'd still have a face

997
01:26:16,038 --> 01:26:18,299
You paid us trinkets to kill a prince

998
01:26:18,516 --> 01:26:20,559
Show me the weapon

999
01:26:21,387 --> 01:26:24,778
Come. Leave your guards outside

1000
01:26:41,518 --> 01:26:44,518
His escape bore unexpected fruit

1001
01:26:46,736 --> 01:26:48,996
So this is how he did it

1002
01:26:49,431 --> 01:26:53,649
This is only a first crude effort.
Stark has perfected his design

1003
01:26:54,476 --> 01:26:57,650
He has made a masterpiece of death

1004
01:26:57,823 --> 01:27:01,302
A man with a dozen of these can rule all of Asia

1005
01:27:02,476 --> 01:27:05,867
And you dream of Stark's throne

1006
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:09,042
We have a common enemy

1007
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:15,738
We are still in business

1008
01:27:17,652 --> 01:27:19,913
I will give you these designs...

1009
01:27:21,390 --> 01:27:23,086
...as a gift

1010
01:27:23,956 --> 01:27:25,999
And in return...

1011
01:27:27,174 --> 01:27:31,913
...I hope you repay me with a gift of iron soldiers

1012
01:27:43,262 --> 01:27:46,305
This is the only gift you will receive

1013
01:27:49,262 --> 01:27:50,827
Technology

1014
01:27:52,437 --> 01:27:56,393
That's always been your Achilles heel in this part of the world

1015
01:27:57,307 --> 01:28:00,785
Don't worry. It will only last for 15 minutes

1016
01:28:01,438 --> 01:28:04,525
That's the least of your problems

1017
01:28:09,177 --> 01:28:12,047
Bring the armour and the rest of it

1018
01:28:13,438 --> 01:28:15,829
Alright, lets finish up here

1019
01:28:19,395 --> 01:28:22,177
Set up Sector 16 underneath the Arc reactor

1020
01:28:22,352 --> 01:28:26,004
And I want this dead and masked. Recruit our top engineers

1021
01:28:26,178 --> 01:28:28,221
I want a prototype right away

1022
01:28:37,092 --> 01:28:38,526
Are you busy?

1023
01:28:39,222 --> 01:28:42,701
I need you to go to my office and hack into the mainframe

1024
01:28:42,918 --> 01:28:45,962
You're gonna retrieve all the recent shipping manifests

1025
01:28:46,136 --> 01:28:48,701
This is a lock chip, this will get you in

1026
01:28:48,919 --> 01:28:51,354
It's probably under Executive Files, if not...

1027
01:28:51,484 --> 01:28:53,919
they put it on a ghost drive, in which case you need to look

1028
01:28:54,137 --> 01:28:55,833
for the lowest numeric heading

1029
01:28:56,006 --> 01:28:58,311
And what do you plan to do with this information

1030
01:28:58,528 --> 01:28:59,919
if I bring it back here? - Same drill

1031
01:29:00,094 --> 01:29:02,311
They've been dealing under the table, I'm gonna stop them

1032
01:29:02,442 --> 01:29:05,441
I'm gonna find my weapons and destroy them

1033
01:29:05,876 --> 01:29:07,484
Tony...

1034
01:29:09,181 --> 01:29:12,007
you know that I would help you with anything

1035
01:29:12,182 --> 01:29:15,269
but I can not help you if you're gonna start all of this again

1036
01:29:15,486 --> 01:29:18,833
There is nothing except this. There's no art openings

1037
01:29:19,052 --> 01:29:22,443
there's no benefit, there's nothing to sign

1038
01:29:23,357 --> 01:29:26,878
There's the next mission, and nothing else

1039
01:29:28,052 --> 01:29:30,095
Is that so?

1040
01:29:31,314 --> 01:29:33,357
Well, then I quit

1041
01:29:35,618 --> 01:29:37,574
You stood by my side all these years

1042
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:40,270
while I reaped the benefits of destruction

1043
01:29:40,619 --> 01:29:42,618
And now that I'm trying to protect the people

1044
01:29:42,793 --> 01:29:44,618
that I've put in harm's way, your going to walk out?

1045
01:29:44,792 --> 01:29:48,792
You're gonna kill yourself, Tony. I'm not gonna be a part of it

1046
01:29:49,315 --> 01:29:53,532
I shouldn't be alive... unless it was for a reason

1047
01:29:55,446 --> 01:29:57,489
I'm not crazy, Pepper

1048
01:29:57,707 --> 01:30:00,967
I just finally know what I have to do

1049
01:30:05,098 --> 01:30:08,620
And I know in my heart that it's right

1050
01:30:23,796 --> 01:30:26,230
You're all I have too, you know

1051
01:31:35,671 --> 01:31:37,670
Sector 16?

1052
01:31:38,844 --> 01:31:40,844
What are you up to, Obadiah?

1053
01:31:53,411 --> 01:31:56,367
You did not tell us that the target you paid us to kill

1054
01:31:56,585 --> 01:31:58,889
was the great Tony Stark. As you can see

1055
01:31:59,107 --> 01:32:02,063
Obadiah Stane, your deception and lies will cost you dearly

1056
01:32:02,237 --> 01:32:05,193
The price to kill Tony Stark has just gone up

1057
01:32:09,238 --> 01:32:13,064
So... what are we gonna do about this?

1058
01:32:25,109 --> 01:32:28,718
I know what you're going through, Pepper

1059
01:32:36,545 --> 01:32:40,066
Ah, Tony. He always gets the good stuff, doesn't he?

1060
01:33:01,547 --> 01:33:03,720
I was so happy...

1061
01:33:05,025 --> 01:33:09,329
when he came home. It was like we got him back from the dead

1062
01:33:11,982 --> 01:33:14,113
And now I realise...

1063
01:33:16,417 --> 01:33:20,287
...well, Tony never really did come home, did he?

1064
01:33:21,069 --> 01:33:24,156
He left a part of himself in that cave

1065
01:33:26,678 --> 01:33:28,721
Breaks my heart

1066
01:33:30,332 --> 01:33:31,636
Well...

1067
01:33:32,766 --> 01:33:35,027
He is a complicated person

1068
01:33:37,245 --> 01:33:41,071
He's been through a lot. I think he'll be alright

1069
01:33:47,202 --> 01:33:50,202
You are a very rare woman

1070
01:33:52,289 --> 01:33:54,898
Tony doesn't know how lucky he is

1071
01:33:57,028 --> 01:33:59,245
Thank you. Thanks

1072
01:34:01,333 --> 01:34:03,333
I gotta get back there

1073
01:34:08,595 --> 01:34:10,986
Is that today's paper?

1074
01:34:12,247 --> 01:34:13,507
Yes

1075
01:34:14,117 --> 01:34:16,943
- Do you mind?
- Not at all

1076
01:34:17,161 --> 01:34:19,465
- Puzzle.
- Of course

1077
01:34:22,813 --> 01:34:24,683
Take care

1078
01:34:48,032 --> 01:34:49,901
Ms. Potts? We had an appointment

1079
01:34:49,989 --> 01:34:51,945
Did you forget about our appointment?

1080
01:34:52,119 --> 01:34:54,858
Nope. Right now, come with me

1081
01:34:56,903 --> 01:34:59,946
I'll give you the meeting of your life. Your office

1082
01:35:00,990 --> 01:35:03,555
We've been working our best

1083
01:35:04,077 --> 01:35:07,121
Absolutely, we're... I'm gonna have to call you back

1084
01:35:07,773 --> 01:35:10,947
Mr. Stane? Sir, we've explored what you've asked us

1085
01:35:11,164 --> 01:35:13,990
and it seems as though there's a little hiccup, actually...

1086
01:35:14,209 --> 01:35:16,513
- A hiccup?
- Yes, to power the suit...

1087
01:35:16,687 --> 01:35:19,121
sir, the technology actually doesn't exist. So it's...

1088
01:35:19,382 --> 01:35:21,382
Wait, wait, the technology?

1089
01:35:21,862 --> 01:35:25,079
William, here is the technology

1090
01:35:25,557 --> 01:35:28,036
I've asked you to simply make it smaller

1091
01:35:28,253 --> 01:35:30,600
Okay, sir, that's what we're trying to do

1092
01:35:30,819 --> 01:35:32,818
but honestly, it's impossible

1093
01:35:32,992 --> 01:35:36,297
Tony Stark was able to build this in a cave!

1094
01:35:36,819 --> 01:35:39,210
With a box of scraps!

1095
01:35:40,819 --> 01:35:44,297
I'm sorry. I'm not Tony Stark

1096
01:35:59,995 --> 01:36:01,385
Tony?

1097
01:36:03,777 --> 01:36:05,603
Tony, are you there?

1098
01:36:08,821 --> 01:36:10,169
Breathe

1099
01:36:11,083 --> 01:36:13,517
Easy, easy...

1100
01:36:16,039 --> 01:36:18,647
You remember this one, right?

1101
01:36:19,735 --> 01:36:22,257
It's a shame the government didn't approve

1102
01:36:22,474 --> 01:36:26,344
There are so many applications regarding short-term paralysis

1103
01:36:28,257 --> 01:36:29,909
Ah, Tony

1104
01:36:32,475 --> 01:36:36,475
When I ordered the hit on you

1105
01:36:39,258 --> 01:36:41,910
I was worried that I was...

1106
01:36:44,824 --> 01:36:47,562
...killing the golden goose

1107
01:36:48,433 --> 01:36:50,476
But, you see...

1108
01:36:51,259 --> 01:36:55,302
it was just fate that you survived it

1109
01:37:00,825 --> 01:37:04,651
leaving one last golden egg to give

1110
01:37:08,956 --> 01:37:12,434
You really think that just because you have an idea

1111
01:37:12,652 --> 01:37:14,651
it belongs to you?

1112
01:37:17,957 --> 01:37:22,218
Your father, he helped to give us the atomic bomb

1113
01:37:22,392 --> 01:37:25,391
Now what kind of world would it be today

1114
01:37:25,610 --> 01:37:27,609
if he was as selfish as you?

1115
01:37:37,436 --> 01:37:39,523
Oh, it's beautiful

1116
01:37:41,871 --> 01:37:43,479
Ah, Tony...

1117
01:37:44,872 --> 01:37:47,394
This is your Ninth Symphony

1118
01:37:48,742 --> 01:37:51,611
What a masterpiece! Look at that

1119
01:37:52,611 --> 01:37:54,828
This is your legacy

1120
01:37:57,046 --> 01:37:59,872
The generation of weapons...

1121
01:38:00,525 --> 01:38:02,959
...with this at its heart

1122
01:38:05,265 --> 01:38:09,091
The weapons that will help stir the world back on course

1123
01:38:09,308 --> 01:38:12,090
With the balance of power in our hands

1124
01:38:13,091 --> 01:38:15,135
In the right hands

1125
01:38:17,918 --> 01:38:22,395
I wish you could see my prototype

1126
01:38:23,918 --> 01:38:29,092
It's not as... not as conservative as yours

1127
01:38:31,527 --> 01:38:34,309
Too bad you had to involve Pepper in this

1128
01:38:34,876 --> 01:38:37,440
I would've preferred that she lived

1129
01:38:50,398 --> 01:38:52,485
What do you mean he paid to have Tony killed?

1130
01:38:52,703 --> 01:38:54,528
Pepper, slow down

1131
01:38:54,747 --> 01:38:57,834
Why would Obadiah... okay, where is Tony now?

1132
01:38:58,008 --> 01:39:00,225
I don't know, he's not answering his phone

1133
01:39:00,442 --> 01:39:02,573
Please go there and make sure everything's okay

1134
01:39:02,747 --> 01:39:05,226
Thank you, Rhodey. I know a shortcut

1135
01:40:11,143 --> 01:40:12,751
Good boy

1136
01:40:52,277 --> 01:40:53,450
Tony?

1137
01:40:56,017 --> 01:40:57,581
Tony?

1138
01:40:58,930 --> 01:41:00,278
Tony?

1139
01:41:05,973 --> 01:41:07,234
Tony!

1140
01:41:10,669 --> 01:41:13,104
- Are you okay?
- Where is Pepper?

1141
01:41:13,844 --> 01:41:17,540
She's fine. She's with five agents that are about to arrest Obadiah

1142
01:41:18,148 --> 01:41:20,148
That's not gonna be enough

1143
01:41:44,106 --> 01:41:45,932
Section 16

1144
01:41:46,889 --> 01:41:48,585
Section 16...

1145
01:41:49,237 --> 01:41:50,759
There it is

1146
01:41:59,107 --> 01:42:01,542
My key's not working, it's not opening the door

1147
01:42:01,804 --> 01:42:04,239
Wow, what is that? It's like a little device, like a thing

1148
01:42:04,456 --> 01:42:07,717
that's gonna pick the lock?
You may wanna take few steps back

1149
01:42:27,023 --> 01:42:30,284
That's the coolest thing I've ever seen. - Not bad, huh?

1150
01:42:31,632 --> 01:42:33,240
Let's do it

1151
01:42:39,197 --> 01:42:41,502
You need me to do anything else?

1152
01:42:41,937 --> 01:42:43,893
Keep the skies clear

1153
01:42:48,720 --> 01:42:50,198
Damn!

1154
01:42:57,982 --> 01:42:59,981
Next time, baby

1155
01:43:30,027 --> 01:43:31,853
Looks like you were right

1156
01:43:32,202 --> 01:43:33,853
He was building a suit

1157
01:43:34,071 --> 01:43:36,027
I thought it'll be bigger

1158
01:44:20,857 --> 01:44:22,292
Take him out!

1159
01:44:32,598 --> 01:44:35,076
How do you think the Mark One chest piece is gonna hold up?

1160
01:44:35,250 --> 01:44:37,119
48% power and falling, sir

1161
01:44:37,337 --> 01:44:40,293
That chest piece was never designed for sustained flight

1162
01:44:40,511 --> 01:44:42,075
Keep me posted

1163
01:44:43,381 --> 01:44:44,815
- Pepper.
- Tony?

1164
01:44:45,033 --> 01:44:46,946
- Tony, are you okay?
- I'm fine

1165
01:44:47,164 --> 01:44:49,425
- Obadiah, he's gone insane.
- I know. Listen!

1166
01:44:49,642 --> 01:44:51,815
- You better get outta there!
- He built the suit

1167
01:44:52,034 --> 01:44:53,468
Get outta there, right now!

1168
01:45:04,557 --> 01:45:06,948
Where do you think you're going?

1169
01:45:12,557 --> 01:45:15,209
Your services are no longer required

1170
01:45:15,949 --> 01:45:17,209
Stane!

1171
01:45:42,473 --> 01:45:44,994
- I love this suit!
- Put them down

1172
01:45:45,212 --> 01:45:47,516
Collateral damage, Tony

1173
01:45:48,820 --> 01:45:51,037
Defer the power to chest piece

1174
01:45:59,908 --> 01:46:02,039
Power reduced to 19%

1175
01:46:09,431 --> 01:46:10,735
Lady!

1176
01:46:37,302 --> 01:46:40,476
For thirty years, I've been holding you up

1177
01:46:44,303 --> 01:46:47,172
I built this company from nothing!

1178
01:46:48,912 --> 01:46:51,825
And nothing is gonna stand in my way

1179
01:46:57,782 --> 01:47:00,304
And least of all, you

1180
01:47:09,870 --> 01:47:12,740
Impressive! You upgraded your armour

1181
01:47:12,957 --> 01:47:15,957
I've made some upgrades of my own

1182
01:47:24,219 --> 01:47:26,218
Sir, it appears that his suit can fly

1183
01:47:26,437 --> 01:47:28,480
Duly noted. Take me to the maximum altitude

1184
01:47:28,654 --> 01:47:31,088
With only 15% power, the odds of reaching that altitude...

1185
01:47:31,307 --> 01:47:33,263
I know the math! Do it!

1186
01:47:41,003 --> 01:47:43,699
Sir, you're not gonna believe this. That thing is back

1187
01:47:43,873 --> 01:47:46,263
Get me major Allen. Scramble the jets!

1188
01:47:48,743 --> 01:47:52,003
Not necessary, people, just the training exercise

1189
01:48:01,396 --> 01:48:03,656
- 13% power, sir.
- Climb!

1190
01:48:07,310 --> 01:48:09,483
-11%.
- Keep going!

1191
01:48:16,266 --> 01:48:19,483
- 7% power.
- Just leave it on the screen, stop telling me

1192
01:48:29,571 --> 01:48:31,136
You had a great idea, Tony

1193
01:48:31,354 --> 01:48:34,136
but my suit is more advanced in every way!

1194
01:48:34,355 --> 01:48:36,702
How'd you solve the icing problem?

1195
01:48:36,833 --> 01:48:38,441
Icing problem?

1196
01:48:40,442 --> 01:48:42,355
Might want to look into it

1197
01:48:54,443 --> 01:48:55,833
2%

1198
01:48:57,921 --> 01:49:00,964
We are now running on emergency backup power

1199
01:49:12,357 --> 01:49:13,661
- Potts!
- Tony!

1200
01:49:13,879 --> 01:49:15,922
Oh my God, are you okay?

1201
01:49:16,097 --> 01:49:19,140
I'm almost dead of power, I gotta get out of this thing

1202
01:49:19,315 --> 01:49:22,053
I'll be right there. - Nice try

1203
01:49:34,359 --> 01:49:36,141
Weapons status?

1204
01:49:36,359 --> 01:49:38,576
Repulsors are off line

1205
01:49:42,621 --> 01:49:44,011
Flairs!

1206
01:49:52,708 --> 01:49:55,013
Very clever, Tony

1207
01:50:00,056 --> 01:50:01,926
- Potts.
- Tony!

1208
01:50:02,143 --> 01:50:04,751
This isn't working, we're gonna have to overload the reactor

1209
01:50:04,970 --> 01:50:07,622
and blast the roof. - How are you gonna do that?

1210
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:09,056
You're gonna do it

1211
01:50:09,275 --> 01:50:11,274
Go to the central console, open up bolt of circuits

1212
01:50:11,449 --> 01:50:13,275
When I clear the roof I'll let you know

1213
01:50:13,492 --> 01:50:15,665
and you're gonna hit the master bypass button

1214
01:50:15,928 --> 01:50:18,145
That's gonna fry everything up here

1215
01:50:19,319 --> 01:50:21,101
Okay, I am going in now

1216
01:50:21,319 --> 01:50:25,189
Make sure you wait till I clear the roof, I'll buy you some time

1217
01:50:34,537 --> 01:50:36,711
This looks important

1218
01:50:57,018 --> 01:51:00,061
I never had a taste for this sort of thing

1219
01:51:00,279 --> 01:51:04,105
but I must admit, I'm deeply enjoying the suit

1220
01:51:12,627 --> 01:51:15,626
You finally outdid yourself, Tony

1221
01:51:17,454 --> 01:51:20,192
It would've made your father proud

1222
01:51:24,367 --> 01:51:27,149
It's ready, Tony! Get off the roof!

1223
01:51:46,281 --> 01:51:47,759
Tony!

1224
01:51:48,891 --> 01:51:50,890
How ironic, Tony!

1225
01:51:52,369 --> 01:51:54,891
Trying to free the world of weapons

1226
01:51:55,108 --> 01:51:57,369
you gave it the best one ever!

1227
01:51:57,587 --> 01:51:59,760
- Pepper!
- And now...

1228
01:52:01,283 --> 01:52:03,673
I'm gonna kill you with it!

1229
01:52:06,326 --> 01:52:08,978
You ripped up my targeting system

1230
01:52:09,153 --> 01:52:11,979
- Hit the button!
- You told me not to!

1231
01:52:12,284 --> 01:52:14,371
Hold still, you little prick

1232
01:52:16,371 --> 01:52:18,936
- Just do it!
- You'll die!

1233
01:52:22,198 --> 01:52:23,588
Push it!

1234
01:53:20,897 --> 01:53:22,419
Tony!

1235
01:53:31,028 --> 01:53:33,072
We've all received the official statement

1236
01:53:33,290 --> 01:53:35,898
of what occurred at Stark Industries last night

1237
01:53:36,116 --> 01:53:39,507
There have been unconfirmed reports that a robotic prototype

1238
01:53:39,682 --> 01:53:42,899
malfunctioned and caused damage to the Arc reactor

1239
01:53:46,160 --> 01:53:48,464
"Iron Man", that's kinda catchy. It's got a nice ring to it

1240
01:53:48,682 --> 01:53:51,725
It's not technically accurate, since it's a gold-titanium alloy

1241
01:53:51,944 --> 01:53:54,552
but it's kinda attractive name anyway

1242
01:53:54,769 --> 01:53:56,551
Here is your alibi

1243
01:53:57,552 --> 01:53:59,987
- Okay.
- You were on your yacht

1244
01:54:00,248 --> 01:54:02,509
We told Pepper to put you in Avalon all night

1245
01:54:02,684 --> 01:54:04,944
and sworn statements from 50 of your guests

1246
01:54:05,162 --> 01:54:08,118
I was thinking maybe we should say it was just Pepper and me

1247
01:54:08,335 --> 01:54:10,117
alone on the island

1248
01:54:11,118 --> 01:54:14,466
That's what happened. Just read it word for word

1249
01:54:16,423 --> 01:54:18,423
There's nothing about Stane here

1250
01:54:18,598 --> 01:54:21,423
That's been handled. He's on vacation

1251
01:54:21,685 --> 01:54:24,728
Small aircraft have such a poor safety record

1252
01:54:24,946 --> 01:54:27,641
What about this whole story that it's a body guard?

1253
01:54:27,859 --> 01:54:30,337
He's my body... ? That's kinda flimsy

1254
01:54:30,512 --> 01:54:32,816
This isn't my first rodeo, Mr. Stark

1255
01:54:33,034 --> 01:54:36,598
Just stick to the official statement and soon this will all be behind you

1256
01:54:36,903 --> 01:54:39,250
You've got 90 seconds

1257
01:54:42,121 --> 01:54:43,903
Oh, agent Coulson

1258
01:54:44,338 --> 01:54:48,338
I just wanted to say thank you very much for all of your help

1259
01:54:48,730 --> 01:54:51,904
That's what we do. You'll be hearing from us

1260
01:54:52,121 --> 01:54:55,512
- From the Strategic Homeland...
- Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D

1261
01:54:55,687 --> 01:54:57,165
Right

1262
01:54:57,949 --> 01:55:01,078
- Lets get the show on the road.
- You know, it's actually...

1263
01:55:01,296 --> 01:55:04,209
...not that bad... even I don't think I'm Iron Man

1264
01:55:04,340 --> 01:55:06,210
- You're not Iron Man.
- Yeah I am

1265
01:55:06,383 --> 01:55:08,209
- You're not.
- Suite yourself

1266
01:55:08,514 --> 01:55:10,905
If I were Iron Man, I'd have this girlfriend

1267
01:55:11,079 --> 01:55:13,514
who knew my true identity. She'd be a wreck

1268
01:55:13,731 --> 01:55:16,122
She'd always be worrying that I was gonna die

1269
01:55:16,341 --> 01:55:18,775
and yet proud of a man I become. She'd be...

1270
01:55:18,950 --> 01:55:22,123
wildly conflicted, which would only make her more...

1271
01:55:23,080 --> 01:55:26,036
crazy about me. Tell me you never think about that night?

1272
01:55:26,168 --> 01:55:28,211
- What night?
- You know

1273
01:55:30,733 --> 01:55:34,385
Are you talking about... the night that we danced

1274
01:55:34,994 --> 01:55:37,559
and went up to the roof...

1275
01:55:38,169 --> 01:55:39,559
and then...

1276
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:44,604
you went downstairs to get me a drink, and you...

1277
01:55:45,430 --> 01:55:47,777
left me there by myself?

1278
01:55:48,082 --> 01:55:50,647
Is that the night you're talking about?

1279
01:55:52,996 --> 01:55:54,778
I thought so

1280
01:55:56,736 --> 01:56:00,432
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
- Yes, that'd be all, Ms. Potts

1281
01:56:00,648 --> 01:56:03,735
And now Mr. Stark has prepared a statement

1282
01:56:04,084 --> 01:56:07,257
He will not be taking any questions, thank you

1283
01:56:10,475 --> 01:56:13,519
It's been a while since I was in front of you

1284
01:56:13,736 --> 01:56:16,518
I figure I'll stick to the cards this time

1285
01:56:18,128 --> 01:56:20,519
There's been speculation that I was involved in the events

1286
01:56:20,737 --> 01:56:22,736
that occurred on a freeway and the rooftop...

1287
01:56:22,955 --> 01:56:26,042
I'm sorry Mr. Stark, but do you honestly expect us to believe that

1288
01:56:26,172 --> 01:56:29,215
that was a bodyguard in a suit, that conveniently appeared

1289
01:56:29,390 --> 01:56:32,259
despite the fact that... - I know that it's confusing...

1290
01:56:32,563 --> 01:56:35,389
It is one thing to question the official story

1291
01:56:35,608 --> 01:56:37,781
and another entirely to make wild accusations

1292
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:39,781
or insinuate that I'm a superhero

1293
01:56:39,999 --> 01:56:42,433
- I never said you're a superhero.
- You didn't?

1294
01:56:42,608 --> 01:56:45,652
Well, good, because that would be outlandish and...

1295
01:56:45,957 --> 01:56:47,652
...fantastic

1296
01:56:50,130 --> 01:56:53,695
I'm just not the hero type, clearly. With this...

1297
01:56:54,217 --> 01:56:57,043
long list of character defects and all the mistakes I've made

1298
01:56:57,218 --> 01:56:59,087
largely in public

1299
01:56:59,696 --> 01:57:02,305
- Just stick to the cards.
- Yeah, okay

1300
01:57:04,436 --> 01:57:06,305
The truth is...

1301
01:57:12,088 --> 01:57:14,523
I am Iron Man

1302
02:05:16,415 --> 02:05:20,064
Jarvis?
Welcome home, sir

1303
02:05:23,297 --> 02:05:25,133
I am Iron Man

1304
02:05:26,386 --> 02:05:28,719
You think you're the only Superhero in the world?

1305
02:05:29,241 --> 02:05:33,932
We are part a bigger universe, yet we know nothing

1306
02:05:34,454 --> 02:05:36,017
Who the hell are you?

1307
02:05:37,062 --> 02:05:39,147
Nick Fury, the Director of SHIELD

1308
02:05:40,191 --> 02:05:41,233
Oh

1309
02:05:41,756 --> 02:05:44,362
I'm here to talk to you about the Avenger Initiative
